In January, the Oppo-owned mobile brand unveiled its new flagship, the OnePlus 11. Earlier this month, the 11R arrived, focused on the growing Indian smartphone market. These days, the company also offers last year\u2019s 10T and 10 Pro, three budget Nord devices, five earbuds and a tablet. A new mechanical keyboard is on the way, along with some rumored foldables.<\/p>\n<p>As change of pace, the company showcased a product this week at MWC that will never see the light of day \u2013 or at least not in its current form. As the name implies, the OnePlus 11 Concept is effectively a remix of the company\u2019s current flagship. The key differentiators, however, point to a company hoping to get more serious about mobile gaming. The gaming phone market has been something of a mixed bag, putting it mildly, and there\u2019s no clear indication that it will ever release such a device.<\/p>\n<p>A more likely approach involves generational advances that make more serious gaming more plausible on the small screen. \u201cWe will make a lot of efforts in research and design of the technology,\u201d OnePlus President and COO Kinder Liu told TechCrunch through a translator. \u201cBut as for the commercial availability of these technologies, we will further analyze the market and the technology\u2019s maturity.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2491174\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2491174\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2491174\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/OnePlus-11-Concept-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/OnePlus-11-Concept-1.jpg 8000w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/OnePlus-11-Concept-1.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/OnePlus-11-Concept-1.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/OnePlus-11-Concept-1.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/OnePlus-11-Concept-1.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/OnePlus-11-Concept-1.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/OnePlus-11-Concept-1.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/OnePlus-11-Concept-1.jpg?resize=1200,675 1200w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/OnePlus-11-Concept-1.jpg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2491174\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> OnePlus<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>Liu explains that gauging consumer interest is one \u201cmultiple reasons\u201d OnePlus went the automaker route with the unveiling of a liquid cooled handset. \u201cAlso, we want to encourage continuous innovation inside our company,\u201d he adds.<\/p>\n<p>OnePlus calls the new technology, \u201cActive CryoFlux.\u201d A 0.2 square centimeter piezoelectric ceramic micropump moves the coolant up and down a pipeline near the rear of the device and around the massive camera array.

It\u2019s a cool effect, and one that invariably shares of comparisons to Phone (1), released by OnePlus cofounder Carl Pei\u2019s Nothing last year.<\/p>\n<p>Given the recent stagnation of broader smartphone innovation, it\u2019s probably inevitable that manufacturers are tweaking product design in new ways.

Community was a major factor in OnePlus\u2019 growth from the outset, but many consumers have feared that being rolled into Chinese mobile giant Oppo has caused it to drift from that initial focus. A prime example are the original plans to merge OnePlus\u2019 OxygenOS with Oppo\u2019s Color OS. The company abandoned the move a year ago, following user backlash.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI think one thing can be improved,\u201d says Liu, \u201cand that\u2019s we need to have better communication with the outside world.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Is gaming the next frontier for device makers now that the initial 5G adoption bump has long since died out? Companies like ASUS, Nubia and Xiaomi are banking on it with the release of devices that center that experience. Giants like Samsung and Apple, on the other hand, seem content to simply make gaming more accessible on their flagship devices. OnePlus seems more likely to follow the latter path, but the phone maker has certainly surprised me before.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/tag\/mwc-2023\/\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/mwc-2023-banner.jpg\" alt=\"Read more about MWC 2023 on TechCrunch\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The days of a cautious OnePlus release cycle appear to be behind us.

Many employees worried that this was the first sign of layoffs to come, and while correlation does not equal causation, an entire company being cut off from their main mode of communication as layoffs started dropping like bombs caused confusion and panic all around.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>&#8220;Slack is gone so noone know what is going on,&#8221; reads one <a href=\"https:\/\/www.teamblind.com\/post\/This-weekend-Layoff-in-Twitter-6bwhhnn7\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">post on Blind<\/a>, an anonymous platform for verified workers. &#8220;People receive email at 2am on saturday and access cut immediately. This will go down as one of the most extreme layoff in entire corporate history&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The post went on to detail the extent of the layoffs: 50% in human relations, 60% in sales and marketing, 35% in engineering, 40% in finance and 80% in project management. Employees have received one month&#8217;s severance, the poster said. Twitter has not responded to requests for comment, nor has it released a public statement on the layoffs.<\/p>\n<p>The Information&#8217;s report also notes that Twitter kicked off this round of layoffs by letting go of its ad sales staff on February 17.<\/p>\n<p>A senior product manager, Martijn de Kuijper, tweeted that he found out about his own lack of a job after being locked out of his email account.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Waking up to find I&#8217;ve been locked out of my email.

As our very own Brian Heater previously <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/11\/17\/boston-scene-report\/\">noted<\/a>, startups are often located in &#8220;a five- to ten-block radius a stone\u2019s throw from MIT (and, for that matter, Harvard).&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>That also explains why Boston startups are associated with &#8216;tough tech&#8217;. &#8220;Boston, world-class universities and hard tech all go together,&#8221; said Sanjiv Kalevar, a partner at OpenView.<\/p>\n<p>This combination is also arguably what makes Boston more resilient in the current downturn. According to Rudina Seseri, founder and managing partner at Glasswing Ventures, &#8220;Boston remains a vibrant startup and VC market in 2023 [&#8230;] Despite tough markets, a recessionary economy, and overall business pessimism, I am confident Boston will see a new wave of founders starting new companies.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>We spoke with:\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/rudinaseseri\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Rudina Seseri<\/a>, founder and managing partner, <a href=\"https:\/\/glasswing.vc\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Glasswing Ventures<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/lilylyman\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Lily Lyman<\/a>, general partner, <a href=\"https:\/\/underscore.vc\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Underscore VC<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/sanjiv-kalevar\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Sanjiv Kalevar<\/a>, partner, <a href=\"https:\/\/openviewpartners.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">OpenView<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/katierae\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Katie Rae<\/a>, managing partner, <a href=\"https:\/\/engine.xyz\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Engine<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/russ-wilcox-2005\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Russ Wilcox<\/a>, partner, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.pillar.vc\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Pillar VC<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<hr \/>\n<h2>Rudina Seseri, founder and managing partner, Glasswing Ventures<\/h2>\n<p><strong>How would you describe the pace of venture capital dealmaking in Boston this year so far?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Boston remains a vibrant startup and VC market in 2023. The overall pace of funding has declined since 2021, but we are continuing to see high-potential companies and founders secure funding today.<\/p>\n<p>We especially see this in the AI and security markets. Recent data published in the Pitchbook-NVCA Venture Monitor shows that Boston had roughly the same share of the number of VC deals in the U.S. between 2021 and 2022, and we expect that trend to continue or improve in 2023.<\/p>\n<p><strong>For a Boston-based founder, does fundraising in 2023 still involve a lot of Zoom calls?

The founder-investor relationship is a lasting one. We enjoy building close bonds with our founders while also giving them the opportunity to meet our building partners.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Have Boston-based tech workers been as affected by layoffs as their peers in the Bay Area?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Every corner of tech has been affected. Yet, despite tough markets, a recessionary economy, and overall business pessimism, I am confident Boston will see a new wave of founders starting new companies.<\/p>\n<p>Innovation shines the brightest in dark times, and it is in these times that transformative ideas are born. Among the technologists laid off from big tech companies recently, we expect many will find a fire in their bellies and build incredible products. Now is an excellent time for early-stage founders to implement their ideas.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Have in-person networking and startup community events in the Boston metropolitan area returned to pre-pandemic levels?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>We have seen the number of events in the broader community tick up and are excited to keep bringing the community together as we head into the spring and summer. We host a wide range of ecosystem events, from networking for the AI and cybersecurity industries, to thought leadership sessions on making your first marketing hire. We will continue to push our ecosystem forward with gatherings at our office in the heart of Back Bay, around the area, or online.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What link do you see, if any, between two of Boston&#8217;s strengths: &#8220;Tough tech&#8221; and university spinouts?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>These are inextricably linked. Boston\u2019s academic rigor is a critical ingredient in delivering the transformative technology that pushes our economy and society forward.<\/p>\n<p>We work very closely with universities and research labs in the area (including, but not limited to, the MIT and Harvard ecosystems) and back leading founders building AI and frontier technology products for the enterprise and security markets.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What\u2019s the most interesting Boston-based company you\u2019ve invested in recently?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>One of our latest investments is in FeatureByte, an AI startup founded by the team that built the backbone for DataRobot. FeatureByte is a platform built specifically for data scientists to simplify the creation, serving, managing and monitoring of machine learning features.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Are you open to cold pitches? How can founders reach you?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Yes, we are open to cold pitches, but prefer warm ones if a founder is able! We are looking for strong founders leveraging AI and frontier technology to build applications and infrastructure for the enterprise and security markets. My email is: rudina@glasswing.vc.<\/p>\n<h2>Lily Lyman, general partner, Underscore VC<\/h2>\n<p><strong>How would you describe the pace of venture capital dealmaking in Boston this year so far?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Looking across the data, it\u2019s clear that the pace of venture dealmaking in Boston slowed in Q3 and Q4 of last year, like everywhere else, as investors and founders were trying to get a sense of the market dynamics.<\/p>\n<p>But thus far in Q1, we are seeing strong, high-quality investment opportunities at the earliest stage. It&#8217;s a great time to invest in early-stage startups. Great founders are starting businesses that are cash-efficient and thinking about business models from Day 1, which helps them attract strong talent at a more affordable rate, face less competition, acquire customers more affordably and solve big problems.<\/p>\n<p>What has changed, particularly at the later stages, are the length and depth of diligence processes. We are no longer seeing the hasty timelines we saw in 2021. Late-stage investors are digging deeper into business fundamentals and projections.

\u2013 like an innovation engine to drive startup ideas. It needs a couple of successful exits, which in turn drives angel investing as entrepreneurs growing increasingly wealthy look to help new founders building companies reach their own goals. It requires accelerators and incubators and coworking spaces to help nurture early ideas, and it needs VC firms investing across stages.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"featured__span-first-words\">Success begets success<\/span>, and before you know it, a startup scene is born.<\/p>\n<p>Boston has all of these elements, starting with a long history of innovation, perhaps not surprising when considering the 44 colleges and universities located in the metro Boston area including Boston University, Tufts, UMass, Northeastern, Harvard and MIT, all of which act as an engine for startup activity.<\/p>\n<p>It also has a long history of innovation and a rich tech legacy.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><em>Attend the TechCrunch City Spotlight: Boston event on February 27, 2023. <\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><em><a href=\"https:\/\/hopin.com\/events\/tc-city-spotlight-boston\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Register for the free virtual event here<\/a>.<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p>Route 128, the highway that runs outside of Boston, was once known as <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2009\/10\/31\/the-valley-of-my-dreams-why-silicon-valley-left-bostons-route-128-in-the-dust\/\">\u2018America\u2019s Technology Highway,<\/a>\u2019 rivaling Silicon Valley for influential tech companies. Consider that mini computer companies like Digital Equipment Corporation, Wang and Data General were born and thrived for a time before falling by the wayside of technology history in metro Boston.<\/p>\n<p>And while we saw a generation of brave founders launching companies from the \u201860s to the \u201880s, it was probably more typical for engineering students coming out of Harvard and MIT to go to big companies like IBM, Texas Instruments, and Motorola with dreams of stability and steady income, rather than starting a company of their own. As such, Silicon Valley remained the tech standard bearer.<\/p>\n<p>In the \u201890s a new generation of Bay State startups started focusing on areas like chips, storage and memory. By the time the new century came around the area began to shift to look like a modern startup scene. Over time the Boston area watched the development of a robust technology startup ecosystem across industries like cybersecurity, robotics and biotech with companies like Hubspot, Wayfair, Rapid7, Boston Dynamics and Moderna, to name but a few.<\/p>\n<p>We are also seeing the rise of a green tech startup scene with companies like Commonwealth Fusion Systems, which has raised $2 billion, Form Energy, which has raised $816 million and Boston Metal, which has raised $200 million, as three examples.<\/p>\n<p>All of these industries have something in common. They require a lot of raw engineering smarts and Boston has an abundance of that.<\/p>\n<p>What is Boston like today and why should founders think about launching their companies here? We spoke to several people who have been investing in this region for years, and while Boston isn\u2019t perfect \u2013 let\u2019s face it, no city is \u2013 it has its charms, and we talked about what kinds of companies and industries have thrived here and why.<\/p>\n<h2>Boston by the numbers<\/h2>\n<p>The chart below shows Boston fluctuating between third and fourth place in overall venture capital investment over the last several years, moving back and forth with the Los Angeles area startup scene.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2489328\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2489328\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout size-full wp-image-2489328\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/regional-investment-dollars-from-pitchbook.jpg\" alt=\"Investment dollars by region based on Pitchbook data.\" width=\"1024\" height=\"389\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/regional-investment-dollars-from-pitchbook.jpg 1174w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/regional-investment-dollars-from-pitchbook.jpg?resize=150,57 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/regional-investment-dollars-from-pitchbook.jpg?resize=300,114 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/regional-investment-dollars-from-pitchbook.jpg?resize=768,292 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/regional-investment-dollars-from-pitchbook.jpg?resize=680,258 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/regional-investment-dollars-from-pitchbook.jpg?resize=50,19 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2489328\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Pitchbook<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>Boston had a steady investment growth trajectory until it dropped off (like everyone else) in 2022 as investment overall slowed in an uncertain economic environment. After topping out in 2021 at $34 billion in total investment, doubling its 2020 output, it dropped to $21 billion last year, behind San Francisco, NY and LA.<\/p>\n<p>Cait Brumme, CEO at early stage tech accelerator MassChallenge says that Boston was not immuned to the vagaries of investment cycles in 2022. Citing those Pitchbook numbers, Brumme noted that area investment growth was down close to 40% last year.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI think that&#8217;s a good directional indicator of the fact that the funding environment has slowed and therefore it&#8217;s much more challenging, for sure,&#8221; she said.<\/p>\n<p>But she says if you have a good idea, there\u2019s still money out there. It\u2019s just harder to come by than earlier years. \u201cWhat we hear is great companies will get funded. And the onus is really on founders to lay out a good process, meaning they know what they&#8217;re going to accomplish. They&#8217;re hitting really strong metrics, they built a good team and they&#8217;re solving a problem that has clear customer traction or demand.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2>Boston strengths<\/h2>\n<p>It\u2019s clear Boston\u2019s universities are a unique differentiator over other top startup centers like NYC and SF. These schools, both private and public, act as an engine for ideas and producer of engineering and business talent.<\/p>\n<p>Greg Dracon, a partner at .406 Ventures, a venture capital firm that focuses on Series A investing, says the schools are a huge advantage for Boston.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cBoston&#8217;s always been a great technology town in my opinion, and it&#8217;s hard to beat [all the] colleges and universities with more STEM grads than in any state in the US. So it&#8217;s always been really good at technology,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<p>He says it\u2019s particularly good at cybersecurity with companies with almost 100 startups headquartered in the city, <a href=\"https:\/\/my.pitchbook.com\/search-results\/s255810800\/companies\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">per Pitchbook data<\/a>. Examples of security companies based in the city include <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/12\/12\/snyk-scores-another-196m-as-valuation-drops-12-to-7-4b-valuation\/\">Snyk<\/a>, a late stage startup, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.rapid7.com\/about\/press-releases\/rapid7-announces-closing-of-initial-public-offering\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Rapid7<\/a>, which IPOed in 2015 and <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/08\/22\/vmware-acquires-carbon-black-for-2-1b-and-pivotal-for-2-7-billion\/\">Carbon Black<\/a>, which VMware acquired for $2.1 billion in 2019.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI would argue even in the 2007 timeframe when we started our firm, we specifically focused on things we think Boston excels at.I lead our cybersecurity investing, and I can talk for hours about cybersecurity. If I were to start a cybersecurity company, there&#8217;s no place in the world I would start it other than Boston,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<p>While New York has easy access to Fortune 500 companies, Dracon says Boston is close enough that the distance isn\u2019t appreciable.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cNew York&#8217;s got all these big companies, which is true. But if you&#8217;re building a startup, especially something that sells to enterprise, those are perfect early adopters and proofs of concept. So it&#8217;s a train ride down to get access to any big decision maker,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cYou have the talent in Boston as you start to scale because universities are spitting people out like crazy. And what&#8217;s different today than 2006 when we started the firm is that we now have very big companies that have gone public or were acquired,\u201d he said, noting these large companies and their founders often act as a startup feeder system.<\/p>\n<p>Ajay Agarwal, a partner at Bain Venture Partners, has been investing in startups since 2007, and he says one of Boston\u2019s biggest strengths is in the sciences. We saw Moderna, a Cambridge, Massachusetts pharmaceutical company emerge from relative obscurity in 2021 when it developed an early COVID vaccine.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI think that the Boston scene, first and foremost, has always had incredible strength around hard science\u2026You think about the stuff that Katie Ray is doing at <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/10\/27\/the-engine-fund-two\/\">The Engine<\/a>, the whole world of life sciences \u2013 we have a separate fund here at Bain Capital that&#8217;s focused on life sciences \u2013 and I think the hard sciences, given the MIT roots, have continued to be, a real strength of the city,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<p>Brumme says her firm tries to take advantage of the city\u2019s strengths in terms of the types of startups the accelerator accepts. \u201cWe&#8217;ve been working hard in and around the area of fintech and digital health for long periods of time, given some of the institutional industry leaders that have characterized Boston&#8217;s corporate landscape and are seeing a lot of momentum in those categories,\u201d she said.<\/p>\n<p>She also mentioned robotics, green technologies and what she calls bio-convergence, a cross pollination between robotics and biotech. \u201cIf you think of MIT&#8217;s AI unit coming together with the Broad Institute\u2019s biotech [focus], and just really fascinating companies [are being created] at that intersection of biology and computer science, and we think Boston has a chance to be a real global leader in that adjacent area as well,\u201d she said.<\/p>\n<h2>It\u2019s not for everyone<\/h2>\n<p>Boston clearly has a lot going for it, but it\u2019s not all things to everyone, and the folks we spoke to said for whatever reason, it hasn\u2019t been a great place to start a consumer company. There are exceptions, of course, like Wayfair selling furniture online and Tripadvisor, running a travel site that was launched in the Boston area, but overall it\u2019s not as well suited to consumer technologies.<\/p>\n<p>Dracon thinks that could be because of the deep tech knowledge in the city, again due to the colleges and universities. \u201cIf there&#8217;s one industry that&#8217;s lacking, its consumer, and it kind of goes with the same thing. We&#8217;re an enterprise, deep tech, somewhat risk-averse town. That&#8217;s more of an enterprise-type of product and sale,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<p>Agarwal agrees, saying the city lacks consumer focus for some reason. \u201cI think the city, good or bad, tends to focus on companies that are real, they&#8217;re adding real values that fundamentally have a defensible value proposition,\u201d he said. \u201cConsumer tech is lighter weight technologically under the hood, and is based more on the application or UI design.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe city doesn&#8217;t have a ton of consumer DNA. It&#8217;s never really been the strength of the city,\u201d Agarwal said.<\/p>\n<p>But Boston has had its share of successes over the years with companies like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/katevinton\/2015\/06\/11\/cybersecurity-firm-rapid7-files-for-80-million-ipo\/?sh=67b92ead19df\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Rapid7<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2014\/10\/09\/hubspot-spikes-20-over-its-ipo-price-in-strong-debut\/\">Hubspot<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2014\/10\/13\/wayfair-and-hubspot-ipos-could-be-just-the-beginning-for-boston-startup-scene\/\">Wayfair<\/a> going public in high profile IPOs. There have also been a number of billion dollar acquisitions led by EMC, which was based outside the city and was <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2015\/10\/12\/dell-buys-emc-for-67b-in-largest-deal-in-tech-history\/\">acquired by Dell<\/a> in 2015 for $67 billion, still one of the largest tech acquisitions in history. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1995\/06\/12\/us\/ibm-wins-lotus-as-offer-is-raised-above-3.5-billion.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">IBM acquired Lotus 1-2-3<\/a>, an early spreadsheet company for the PC for $3.5 billion in 1995, VMware bought cybersecurity company <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/08\/22\/vmware-acquires-carbon-black-for-2-1b-and-pivotal-for-2-7-billion\/\">Carbon Black for $2.1 billion <\/a>2019, and Vista Equity Partners <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/09\/24\/vista-equity-partners-buys-acquia-for-1b\/\">bought Acquia<\/a>, the commercial company built on top of the open source Drupal project, for $1 billion also in 2019.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s fair to say that Boston lacks some of the glitz and glamor of other cities, and there has been a history of Yankee frugality, that perhaps has led to a reputation of being risk-averse when it comes to investing in consumer-facing companies. There has also been a tendency to not want to toot its own horn that has allowed Silicon Valley to grab the spotlight and the attention, especially in the \u201890s. Over the last 15 or 20 years, Boston has built an ecosystem to rival Silicon Valley and NYC, making it a place where startups can launch and grow and thrive with a deep pool of talent in their own backyard.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout embed-oembed embed--techcrunch\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"KG5q14EZ2N\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/02\/27\/5-investors-discuss-why-bostons-tech-ecosystem-is-as-resilient-as-they-come\/\">5 investors discuss Boston\u2019s resilient tech ecosystem<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;5 investors discuss Boston\u2019s resilient tech ecosystem&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/02\/27\/5-investors-discuss-why-bostons-tech-ecosystem-is-as-resilient-as-they-come\/embed\/#?secret=T4OIA0oa00#?secret=KG5q14EZ2N\" data-secret=\"KG5q14EZ2N\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<div class=\"embed breakout embed-oembed embed--techcrunch\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"OMyG9KNXwY\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/02\/27\/bostons-university-to-startup-pipeline-defies-downturn-to-grow-and-diversify\/\">Boston&#8217;s university-to-startup pipeline defies downturn to grow and diversify<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Boston&#8217;s university-to-startup pipeline defies downturn to grow and diversify&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/02\/27\/bostons-university-to-startup-pipeline-defies-downturn-to-grow-and-diversify\/embed\/#?secret=QragAO5RkB#?secret=OMyG9KNXwY\" data-secret=\"OMyG9KNXwY\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In order to build a startup culture, a city or region needs some key elements in place \u2013 like an innovation engine to drive startup ideas.

backs a new system that allows minors to stop their intimate images from being posted online"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">Meta <a href=\"https:\/\/about.fb.com\/news\/2023\/02\/helping-prevent-the-spread-of-young-peoples-intimate-images-online\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">announced<\/a> today it&#8217;s helping finance a new organization called <a href=\"https:\/\/takeitdown.ncmec.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Take It Down<\/a> that will, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.missingkids.org\/blog\/2023\/ncmec-launches-new-service-that-can-help-you-take-it-down\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">with the support of<\/a> the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC), help young people under 18 years old prevent intimate images of themselves from spreading online. The system works similarly to <a href=\"https:\/\/stopncii.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">an earlier Facebook initiative<\/a> designed to prevent the spread of non-consensual intimate imagery, sometimes referred to as &#8220;revenge porn.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Alongside the launch, Meta says it&#8217;s also rolling out new tools that will make it more difficult for &#8220;suspicious adults&#8221; to interact with teens on Instagram.<\/p>\n<p>The company claims the new take-down system for non-consensual intimate imagery is designed in a way to protect user privacy as it won&#8217;t require young people to actually share the images themselves with Meta or another organization. Instead, the system will assign a unique hash value &#8212; a numerical code &#8212; to the image or video directly from the user&#8217;s own device. This hash will then be submitted to NCMEC, then allowing any company to find copies of those images and take them down automatically, in addition to preventing them from being posted in the future.<\/p>\n<p>The original, so-called &#8220;revenge porn&#8221; system <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2017\/11\/09\/facebook-revenge-porn-pilot-details\/\">had been criticized during its pilot<\/a> for requiring user uploads before the hash was created, as security experts pushed back that it wasn&#8217;t the most responsible method of dealing with intimate content. It&#8217;s since been retooled to <a href=\"https:\/\/stopncii.org\/faq\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">create hashes locally<\/a>, noting in help documentation that &#8220;your images will never leave your computer.&#8221; Now, this new Take It Down system appears to utilize the same methodology.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Having a personal intimate image shared with others can be scary and overwhelming, especially for young people,&#8221; writes Meta&#8217;s Global Head of Safety, Antigone Davis, in the announcement. &#8220;It can feel even worse when someone tries to use those images as a threat for additional images, sexual contact or money \u2014 a crime known as sextortion.&#8221;<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout embed-oembed embed--video embed--youtube\"><iframe class=\"embed-iframe embed-iframe--youtube\" title=\"You can\u2019t go back and unsend your explicit images, but we can help.\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/pAaXbBzVdJE?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>Though aimed at young people whose intimate images are being shared non-consensually &#8212; and illegally &#8212; Meta notes that this system can also be used by adults, including parents or guardians of the young person, or even adults worried about non-consensual images taken of themselves when they were younger.<\/p>\n<p>The Take It Down website also connects people to other NCMEC resources, including tools to search to see if your own explicit imagery is out there on the web, a CyberTipline to report anyone threatening you over images or other forms of online exploitation, and more.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>While Meta helped financially back the system by providing initial funding and will use it across Facebook and Instagram, other participating companies who have signed up to participate in using the new technology include social network Yubo as well as adult sites OnlyFans and Pornhub (Mindgeek). Notably absent from the list are other big tech companies like Twitter and Snapchat.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"ncmec2-p3\">Since then, more than 200 cases have been submitted.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>NCMEC says the system actually launched in December 2022 &#8212; ahead of this public announcement &#8212; and has since seen more than 200 cases submitted. A new PSA created by ad agency VCCP will appear on platforms used by kids to ensure its seen.<\/p>\n<p>The system could be a useful tool for people who are aware of or in possession of the non-consensual images being shared, presuming they know this takedown option exists. While companies were already legally bound to report child sexual abuse material, or CSAM, to NCMEC, their systems or processes for detecting this material have been left up to them to implement. Current federal law does not mandate if or how they must search for this type of imagery on their platforms, leading to the spread of CSAM across platforms. Not surprisingly, given its <a href=\"https:\/\/investor.fb.com\/investor-news\/press-release-details\/2022\/Meta-Reports-Third-Quarter-2022-Results\/default.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">2.96 billion monthly users<\/a> for Facebook alone, is a large contributor to this <a href=\"https:\/\/www.missingkids.org\/gethelpnow\/cybertipline#bythenumbers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">growing<\/a> problem. Meanwhile, attempts to <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/EARN_IT_Act\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">pass new legislation<\/a>, like EARN IT, that would close this loophole have not yet been successful. (Though that particular <a href=\"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/bill\/117th-congress\/senate-bill\/3538\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">bill<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/technology\/2022\/02\/10\/senators-earn-it-privacy-children-safety\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">was also controversial<\/a> due to its potential unintended consequences on freedom of speech and consumer privacy, critics have argued.)<\/p>\n<p>But the lack of legislation in this area has forced platforms like Meta to self-regulate when it comes to if and how they&#8217;ll manage this type of content and others. With Congress seemingly unable to pass new laws designed for the internet age, legal liability concerns about big tech&#8217;s responsibility for the content on their platforms have now made their way to the Supreme Court. There, the justices are reviewing Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which had been created in the internet&#8217;s early days to protect websites from being legally liable for the content users post. New cases involving Twitter and Google&#8217;s YouTube &#8212; and their accompanying recommendation algorithms &#8212; will determine if those decades-old protections should be rolled backed or even overturned. Though not related to CSAM, they&#8217;re another example of how the overall system of platform regulation is broken in the U.S.<\/p>\n<p>Without guidance from the law, platforms like Meta have been making up their own rules and policies in areas around algorithm choice, design, recommendation technology, and end user protections.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-2491588\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/03_Comment-Control.webp?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"592\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/03_Comment-Control.webp 3840w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/03_Comment-Control.webp?resize=150,131 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/03_Comment-Control.webp?resize=300,261 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/03_Comment-Control.webp?resize=768,669 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/03_Comment-Control.webp?resize=680,592 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/03_Comment-Control.webp?resize=1536,1338 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/03_Comment-Control.webp?resize=2048,1783 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/03_Comment-Control.webp?resize=1200,1045 1200w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/03_Comment-Control.webp?resize=50,44 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>In more recent months, Meta has been ramping up its protections for teens in anticipation of coming regulations by doing things like setting <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/07\/27\/instagram-to-default-young-teens-to-private-accounts-restrict-ads-and-unwanted-adult-contact\/\">new teen accounts<\/a> to <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/11\/21\/meta-rolls-out-new-privacy-updates-teens-instagram-facebook\/\">private by default<\/a> and applying its <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/08\/25\/instagram-now-defaults-new-users-under-16-to-most-restrictive-content-setting-adds-prompts-for-existing-teens\/\">most restrictive settings<\/a>, in addition to rolling out a <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/03\/16\/instagram-adds-new-teen-safety-tools-as-competition-with-tiktok-heats-up\/\">variety of safety tools<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/03\/16\/instagram-rolls-out-new-safety-tools-for-parents\/\">parental controls<\/a>. Among these updates were specific features aimed at restricting adult users from contacting teens they didn&#8217;t know and warning teens of adults engaged in suspicious behavior &#8212; like sending a large number of friend requests to teen users, for instance.<\/p>\n<p>Today, Meta says suspicious adults will no longer be able to see teen accounts when scrolling through the list of people who have liked a post or when looking at an account&#8217;s Followers or Following list, further cutting off their access.

The Pok\u00e9mon Company also shared a long-awaited update on its sleep-tracking app, Pok\u00e9mon Sleep.<\/p>\n<p>Already in Pok\u00e9mon Go, players can obtain regional variants of the butterfly Pok\u00e9mon <a href=\"https:\/\/bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net\/wiki\/Vivillon_(Pok%C3%A9mon)\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Vivillon<\/a> by collecting in-game postcards from other trainers around the world. Now, Pok\u00e9mon Go players can send those postcards into their Pok\u00e9mon Scarlet and Violet games on the Nintendo Switch, which will cause that specific Vivillon variant to spawn. Then, on the Pok\u00e9mon Go side, this will trigger the Pok\u00e9mon Gimmighoul to appear in its roaming form. Normally, Gimmighoul can be caught as a Pok\u00e9mon that lives inside of a treasure chest, which is also part of its body (yes, it&#8217;s weird, don&#8217;t ask), but in roaming form, it&#8217;s just a silly little grey guy with a golden coin. The Pok\u00e9mon can evolve into Gholdengo after trainers collect 999 Gimmighoul coins.<\/p>\n<p>This integration is similar to the link between Pok\u00e9mon Go and the Nintendo Switch games Let&#8217;s Go Pikachu &amp; Eevee. Like Gimmighoul, the only way to catch a Meltan in Pok\u00e9mon Go is to connect the game to your console, which triggers a mystery box event. Meltan evolves into Melmetal, a very useful and powerful Pok\u00e9mon for PvP battling.<\/p>\n<p>Pok\u00e9mon Scarlet &amp; Violet will also soon be compatible with Pok\u00e9mon Home, a subscription-based mobile app that allows players to transfer Pok\u00e9mon across games. Once that integration is up and running, players will be able to transfer their roaming form Gimmighoul to their Scarlet &amp; Violet games, making it the only way to use the Pok\u00e9mon in that form.<\/p>\n<p>Speaking of Pok\u00e9mon Scarlet &amp; Violet: yes, we now know for sure that there will be a DLC. However, the first part of the expansion content &#8220;The Hidden Treasure of Area Zero&#8221; won&#8217;t be available until fall, with a second part following in winter. When Scarlet &amp; Violet was released, <a href=\"https:\/\/screenrant.com\/pokemon-scarlet-violet-glitches-miraidon-bugs-funny\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">riddled<\/a> with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.polygon.com\/pokemon\/23483896\/pokemon-scarlet-violet-item-pokemon-dupe-glitch-bug\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">glitches<\/a>, we saw how bad things can get when Pok\u00e9mon staff are rushed to churn out new games &#8212; so as far as I&#8217;m concerned, they can take all the time they want.<\/p>\n<p>In other mobile Pok\u00e9mon news, the Pok\u00e9mon Company finally shared an update about Pok\u00e9mon Sleep, an app that the company has been teasing since 2019.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The idea behind Pok\u00e9mon Sleep is to be a game that makes you look forward to waking up in the morning,&#8221; said Pok\u00e9mon Company COO Takato Utsunomiya. That sounds a little bleak!<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>The game takes place on a small island, where we encounter a big Snorlax, along with Pok\u00e9mon sleep researcher Professor Neroli (how do I get that job?). If you leave your phone by your pillow as you sleep, the game will record your sleep and analyze it &#8212; of course, we don&#8217;t know yet whether or not this data is actually accurate or useful.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2491555\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2491555\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2491555\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/Screen-Shot-2023-02-27-at-10.18.20-AM.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"385\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/Screen-Shot-2023-02-27-at-10.18.20-AM.png 1876w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/Screen-Shot-2023-02-27-at-10.18.20-AM.png?resize=150,85 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/Screen-Shot-2023-02-27-at-10.18.20-AM.png?resize=300,170 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/Screen-Shot-2023-02-27-at-10.18.20-AM.png?resize=768,435 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/Screen-Shot-2023-02-27-at-10.18.20-AM.png?resize=680,385 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/Screen-Shot-2023-02-27-at-10.18.20-AM.png?resize=1536,870 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/Screen-Shot-2023-02-27-at-10.18.20-AM.png?resize=1200,680 1200w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/Screen-Shot-2023-02-27-at-10.18.20-AM.png?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2491555\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> The Pok\u00e9mon Company<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>Your sleep will be characterized as dozing, snoozing or slumbering, and Pok\u00e9mon that sleep the same way you do (&#8230; according to this sleep researcher fellow) will gather around your Snorlax. The app will be available on iOS and Android this summer.<\/p>\n<p>To tie Pok\u00e9mon Go and Pok\u00e9mon Sleep together, the Pok\u00e9mon announced the Pok\u00e9mon Go Plus + accessory (no, that&#8217;s not a typo, and yes, it is pronounced &#8220;plus plus&#8221;). Like the existing Pok\u00e9mon Go Plus, the gadget can spin Pok\u00e9stops and catch Pok\u00e9mon for you in Pok\u00e9mon Go. The new device also tracks your sleep and can sing you lullabies in a Pikachu voice, if that&#8217;s your thing.

with the concept of LTV (lifetime value) and its importance in determining the success of your acquisition strategies. But, are you utilizing predictive LTV in your day-to-day decision-making? If not, you&#8217;re missing out on a powerful tool that can give you a competitive edge and an opportunity drive growth for your business.<\/p>\n<p>Predictive LTV is a method of precisely estimating the future value of a customer, based on their historical behavior and other relevant data. By combining this prediction with traditional metrics such as CAC (customer acquisition cost), you gain a new dimension of knowledge that was previously inaccessible to you. This allows you to make more informed decisions that balance the cost of acquisition with your predicted return on investment.<\/p>\n<p>In a sense, not using predictive LTV to inform decisions is like going on a hike, not knowing where it will end and how hard it will be. You may have a general idea of where you\u2019re going, but without advanced tools and technology, you could easily get lost, sidetracked or miss your destination altogether.<\/p>\n<p>Identifying high-value customers early in their life cycle is one of the biggest benefits of predictive LTV. You can use this to build more targeted, effective acquisition strategies, that focus on acquiring and retaining customers. In addition, you can decide how much to invest in acquisition and retention efforts based on your customers&#8217; predicted lifetime value.<\/p>\n<h2>CAC-only optimization<\/h2>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2490962\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2490962\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout size-full wp-image-2490962\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/cac-only-based-optimization.png\" alt=\"a chart depicting CAC-only based acquistion\" width=\"1024\" height=\"582\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/cac-only-based-optimization.png 3477w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/cac-only-based-optimization.png?resize=150,85 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/cac-only-based-optimization.png?resize=300,170 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/cac-only-based-optimization.png?resize=768,436 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/cac-only-based-optimization.png?resize=680,386 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/cac-only-based-optimization.png?resize=1536,873 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/cac-only-based-optimization.png?resize=2048,1164 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/cac-only-based-optimization.png?resize=1200,682 1200w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/cac-only-based-optimization.png?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2490962\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">CAC-only optimization. <strong>Image Credits: <\/strong>Voyantis<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<h2>CAC and predictive LTV optimization<\/h2>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2490966\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2490966\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout size-full wp-image-2490966\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/CAC-and-Predictive-LTV-based-optimization.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"582\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/CAC-and-Predictive-LTV-based-optimization.png 3476w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/CAC-and-Predictive-LTV-based-optimization.png?resize=150,85 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/CAC-and-Predictive-LTV-based-optimization.png?resize=300,170 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/CAC-and-Predictive-LTV-based-optimization.png?resize=768,436 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/CAC-and-Predictive-LTV-based-optimization.png?resize=680,386 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/CAC-and-Predictive-LTV-based-optimization.png?resize=1536,873 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/CAC-and-Predictive-LTV-based-optimization.png?resize=2048,1164 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/CAC-and-Predictive-LTV-based-optimization.png?resize=1200,682 1200w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/CAC-and-Predictive-LTV-based-optimization.png?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2490966\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">CAC and predictive LTV optimization. <strong>Image Credits: <\/strong>Voyantis<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<h2>Balancing risk and growth with predictive LTV<\/h2>\n<p>Before delving into the different approaches to predictive LTV, it&#8217;s important to understand the type of decisions that predictive LTV can inform.

Amid growing geopolitical tensions, drone makers are seeing increased demand and acceptance as drones move farther from consumers&#8217; hands. <\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.skydio.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Skydio<\/a> today announced a $230 million series E fundraising round and the construction of a new manufacturing facility in America. The company says it&#8217;s seen a 30x growth over the last three years and is now the largest drone manufacturer in the United States. The Series E round was led by Linse Capital, with participation from existing investors Andreessen Horowitz, Next47, IVP, DoCoMo, NVIDIA, the Walton Family Foundation, and UP.Partners. Hercules Capital, and Axon, the company behind the Taser and police body cameras, also invested in Skydio.<\/p>\n<p>Skydio says its drones are used in every branch of the U.S. Department of Defense, by over half of all U.S. State Departments of Transportation, and by over 200 public safety agencies in 47 states. But, of course, it helps that government agencies cannot purchase or use drones from the market leader DJI because of security concerns.<\/p>\n<p>In a released statement, Skydio co-founder and CEO Adam Bry says the company sees &#8220;extraordinary demand globally from organizations addressing needs important to every citizen.&#8221; This includes, in his view, core industries such as transportation, public safety, energy, construction, communications, defense, and more. <\/p>\n<p>Skydio sets itself apart from the competition on its autonomous capabilities. The company had viral success with its original drone that featured a market-leading collision avoidance detection. The company still offers such capabilities but has pushed the industry forward with additional features and capabilities. Last December, Skydio <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/12\/07\/skydio-takes-flight-with-new-drone-docking-stations-for-easy-remote-deployment\/\">announced a docking station and a new platform<\/a> that allows drone operators to be flown without an on-site operator. Current regulations around visual piloting limit this product, but Skydio has a solution for that, too, and now works with companies to expand their drone programs.<\/p>\n<p>The new Skydio manufacturing facility is based in Hayward, CA. The facility is 36,000 square feet, a 10x increase in capacity over current levels. In addition, the company expects to hire 150 manufacturing employees to staff the new facility. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Drones are quickly becoming more than a flying selfie cameras.

rel=\"noopener\">Champions Round<\/a>, a fantasy league startup that caters to Gen Z sports fans, announced today that it raised $7 million in new Series A funding.<\/p>\n<p>The funding round will go towards developing a new \u201cCreator Rooms\u201d feature, which gives sports content creators the opportunity to engage further with younger players by creating content and fantasy sports games, whether that be hosting a combined two-week NHL and NBA snake draft, creating polls and more.<\/p>\n<p>The Series A was co-led by Point72 Ventures and Goodwater Capital, with additional investments from Pipeline Capital, Quest Venture Partners, Mana Ventures, Band of Angels and Gaingels. To date, the company has raised $10 million.<\/p>\n<p>Users, particularly Gen Z users, are moving away from traditional fantasy sports, where leagues are tied to entire seasons. Instead, many users are opting for <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/tag\/daily-fantasy-sports\/\">daily fantasy sports<\/a> (DFS), a subcategory of fantasy sports games, where players compete over short-term periods rather than an entire season. The Fantasy Sports &amp; Gaming Association (FSGA) <a href=\"https:\/\/thefsga.org\/records-broken-in-legal-sports-wagering-and-fantasy-sports-participation\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">reported<\/a> that over 30 million people in the U.S. participate in DFS, up 12% from 2019.<\/p>\n<p>Champions Round offers a version of this that it has dubbed &#8220;micro fantasy sports,&#8221; which are short-form games users can play daily, weekly, monthly, or quarterly. For instance, users can draft and manage a team around a single event like the NFL draft, removing the need for a season-long commitment.<\/p>\n<p>FanDuel and DraftKings currently dominate the daily fantasy sports industry. However, the majority of DFS games require money to play. Meanwhile, Champions Round offers two options&#8211; free or buy-in.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cFantasy sports historically demand lengthy commitments, seldom reward their players, and can be very tricky and cumbersome to play,\u201d co-founder and CEO of Champions Round, Carter Russ, said in a statement. \u201cWith a rock-solid game loop, we\u2019ve developed short-form games that beckon for friends to play with one another over and over again.\u201d<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>As Champions Round continues to invest in its Gen Z-focused app, it will launch a new Creator Rooms feature in July 2023. The upcoming feature will help creators monetize larger audiences, the company claims.<\/p>\n<p>Champions Round explained to TechCrunch that it rewards content creators for playing fantasy league games with their followers. The company didn&#8217;t specify how much the influencers earn, but said they are based on engagement and number of sign ups.<\/p>\n<p>Eventually, Champions Round will automatically pay creators within the platform for &#8220;engagement, sign ups, cosmetic items sold within their rooms, revenue share and ad revenue,&#8221; the company told us.<\/p>\n<p>Some notable first- and third-party content creators include <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/@Dom2k16\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Dom2k<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/fantasy.football.analyst\/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Fantasy Football Analyst<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/DanTitus\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Dan Titus<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/JeffHaseley?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Jeff Haseley<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.tiktok.com\/@trell.jones\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Trell Jones<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/TeeOffSports\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Spencer Aguiar<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/StephieSmallls\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Steph Smalls<\/a> and more.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;[Gen Z] doesn\u2019t watch full sports games, but rather consumes sports on social media by following content creators, athletes, teams, personalities, and highlights. By making games that match this bite-sized serialized sports fandom, we\u2019re really appealing to their needs,&#8221; the company added.<\/p>\n<p>Champions Round has also received backing from professional sports players, according to the company. This includes former NBA point guard Baron Davis, Kansas City Chiefs running back Melvin Gordon, New Orleans Saints safety Tyrann Mathieu and basketball player Zaire Wade (the son of former Miami Heat shooting guard Dwayne Wade), among others.<\/p>\n<p>The recent funding will be put toward its content business, which includes social media platforms (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/championsround\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Instagram<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/ChampionsRound\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Twitter<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.tiktok.com\/@championsround\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">TikTok<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/discord.com\/invite\/bsvGf5Wkca\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Discord<\/a>), <a href=\"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/show\/1w9KlFgIrGtSQQOiw6zELd?si=de026945c6924469&amp;nd=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">podcasts <\/a>and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/@championsround\/videos\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">YouTube<\/a> channel.<\/p>\n<p>Additionally, it will allow the company to build a new marketing department as well as double its overall team size from approximately 30 to 60 employees.

The company <a href=\"https:\/\/newsroom.snap.com\/say-hi-to-my-ai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">announced<\/a> today that it&#8217;s launching &#8220;My AI,&#8221; a new chatbot running the latest version of OpenAI&#8217;s GPT technology that it has customized for its users. My AI is now available as an experimental feature for <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/01\/31\/snapchat-now-has-more-than-2-million-paid-subscribers\/\">Snapchat+<\/a>, the social network&#8217;s $3.99 a month subscription service.<\/p>\n<p>The new chatbot will be pinned to the top of the Chat tab. My AI can do things like help answer a trivia question or write a haiku. My AI was trained to have a unique voice and personality that plays into its values about &#8220;friendship, learning and fun.&#8221; It has also been trained to adhere to the app&#8217;s trust and safety guidelines.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;My AI can recommend birthday gift ideas for your BFF, plan a hiking trip for a long weekend, suggest a recipe for dinner, or even write a haiku about cheese for your cheddar-obsessed pal,&#8221; the company wrote in a <a href=\"https:\/\/newsroom.snap.com\/say-hi-to-my-ai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">blog post<\/a>. &#8220;Make My AI your own by giving it a name and customizing the wallpaper for your Chat.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Snapchat notes that &#8220;as with all AI-powered chatbots,&#8221; My AI can be tricked into saying just about anything. The company seems to be alluding <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/02\/16\/microsoft-bing-provoked-respond-outside-of-designed-tone\/\">to the mess<\/a> created by Microsoft&#8217;s Bing, which was recently <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/02\/07\/microsoft-launches-the-new-bing-with-chatgpt-built-in\/\">updated with OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4 model.<\/a> A week into the launch, people started posting strange and unnerving responses that they received from the search engine, after which <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/02\/16\/microsoft-bing-provoked-respond-outside-of-designed-tone\/\">Microsoft admitted<\/a> that Bing can be provoked to respond outside of its &#8220;designed tone.&#8221; Snapchat appears to be getting ahead of dealing with a similar situation with its own chatbot, noting that My AI has &#8220;many deficiencies.&#8221; Snapchat even went so far as saying &#8220;sorry in advance&#8221; to users of the new chatbot.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2491530\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2491530\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2491530\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/MyAI_Comms_GIF_16x9_022323.gif\" alt=\"Snapchat's new AI chatbot\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2491530\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Snapchat<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that unlike Microsoft&#8217;s vision with Bing, Snapchat&#8217;s My AI isn&#8217;t meant to act as a search engine. It&#8217;s instead seen as a persona within Snapchat that you can chat with like you would with your friends.<\/p>\n<p>All conversations with My AI will be stored and may be reviewed to improve the product&#8217;s experience. Snapchat also says that users shouldn&#8217;t share any secrets with My AI or rely on the chatbot for advice. The company says that although My AI is designed to avoid biased, incorrect, harmful, or misleading information, mistakes may occur. The social network notes invites users to submit feedback by pressing and holding on any message from My AI<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Since its launch a few months ago, Open AI&#8217;s ChatGPT has dominated the internet and become increasingly popular. As a result, AI has become an increasingly trending topic over the past few months. Given these factors, it&#8217;s not surprising that Snapchat is adding an AI chatbot to its own messaging platform.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, given that Snapchat caters to a young user base, the idea of safety is pretty important. Snapchat notes that the chatbot has been designed to avoid harmful or misleading topics, and won&#8217;t provide responses in these circumstances.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Our app reaches 750 million people per month, with 75% of 13- to 34-year-olds in over 20 countries,&#8221; the company notes in the blog post. &#8220;Incorporating this technology into Snapchat\u2019s messaging platform has the potential to make these interactions with AI part of what draws our community to Snapchat.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Snapchat says it believes that over time, AI can be incredibly additive to the app&#8217;s experience, while also helping to foster deeper connections. In the short term, My AI may boost the company\u2019s paid subscriber numbers, which <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/01\/31\/snapchat-now-has-more-than-2-million-paid-subscribers\/\">recently surpassed<\/a> the two million mark.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout embed-oembed embed--techcrunch\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"0ic0MXKwUK\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/02\/16\/snapchat-announces-750-million-monthly-active-users\/\">Snapchat announces 750M monthly active users<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Snapchat announces 750M monthly active users&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/02\/16\/snapchat-announces-750-million-monthly-active-users\/embed\/#?secret=mfwZnFBPTQ#?secret=0ic0MXKwUK\" data-secret=\"0ic0MXKwUK\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Snapchat is the latest company to get in on the AI frenzy.

It requires accelerators and incubators and coworking spaces to help nurture early ideas, and it needs VC firms investing across stages.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"featured__span-first-words\">Success begets success<\/span>, and before you know it, a startup scene is born.<\/p>\n<p>Boston has all of these elements, starting with a long history of innovation, perhaps not surprising when considering the 44 colleges and universities located in the metro Boston area including Boston University, Tufts, UMass, Northeastern, Harvard and MIT, all of which act as an engine for startup activity.<\/p>\n<p>It also has a long history of innovation and a rich tech legacy.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><em>Attend the TechCrunch City Spotlight: Boston event on February 27, 2023. <\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><em><a href=\"https:\/\/hopin.com\/events\/tc-city-spotlight-boston\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Register for the free virtual event here<\/a>.<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p>Route 128, the highway that runs outside of Boston, was once known as <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2009\/10\/31\/the-valley-of-my-dreams-why-silicon-valley-left-bostons-route-128-in-the-dust\/\">\u2018America\u2019s Technology Highway,<\/a>\u2019 rivaling Silicon Valley for influential tech companies. Consider that mini computer companies like Digital Equipment Corporation, Wang and Data General were born and thrived for a time before falling by the wayside of technology history in metro Boston.<\/p>\n<p>And while we saw a generation of brave founders launching companies from the \u201860s to the \u201880s, it was probably more typical for engineering students coming out of Harvard and MIT to go to big companies like IBM, Texas Instruments, and Motorola with dreams of stability and steady income, rather than starting a company of their own. As such, Silicon Valley remained the tech standard bearer.<\/p>\n<p>In the \u201890s a new generation of Bay State startups started focusing on areas like chips, storage and memory. By the time the new century came around the area began to shift to look like a modern startup scene. Over time the Boston area watched the development of a robust technology startup ecosystem across industries like cybersecurity, robotics and biotech with companies like Hubspot, Wayfair, Rapid7, Boston Dynamics and Moderna, to name but a few.<\/p>\n<p>We are also seeing the rise of a green tech startup scene with companies like Commonwealth Fusion Systems, which has raised $2 billion, Form Energy, which has raised $816 million and Boston Metal, which has raised $200 million, as three examples.<\/p>\n<p>All of these industries have something in common. They require a lot of raw engineering smarts and Boston has an abundance of that.<\/p>\n<p>What is Boston like today and why should founders think about launching their companies here? We spoke to several people who have been investing in this region for years, and while Boston isn\u2019t perfect \u2013 let\u2019s face it, no city is \u2013 it has its charms, and we talked about what kinds of companies and industries have thrived here and why.<\/p>\n<h2>Boston by the numbers<\/h2>\n<p>The chart below shows Boston fluctuating between third and fourth place in overall venture capital investment over the last several years, moving back and forth with the Los Angeles area startup scene.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2489328\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2489328\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout size-full wp-image-2489328\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/regional-investment-dollars-from-pitchbook.jpg\" alt=\"Investment dollars by region based on Pitchbook data.\" width=\"1024\" height=\"389\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/regional-investment-dollars-from-pitchbook.jpg 1174w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/regional-investment-dollars-from-pitchbook.jpg?resize=150,57 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/regional-investment-dollars-from-pitchbook.jpg?resize=300,114 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/regional-investment-dollars-from-pitchbook.jpg?resize=768,292 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/regional-investment-dollars-from-pitchbook.jpg?resize=680,258 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/regional-investment-dollars-from-pitchbook.jpg?resize=50,19 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2489328\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Pitchbook<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>Boston had a steady investment growth trajectory until it dropped off (like everyone else) in 2022 as investment overall slowed in an uncertain economic environment. After topping out in 2021 at $34 billion in total investment, doubling its 2020 output, it dropped to $21 billion last year, behind San Francisco, NY and LA.<\/p>\n<p>Cait Brumme, CEO at early stage tech accelerator MassChallenge says that Boston was not immuned to the vagaries of investment cycles in 2022. Citing those Pitchbook numbers, Brumme noted that area investment growth was down close to 40% last year.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI think that&#8217;s a good directional indicator of the fact that the funding environment has slowed and therefore it&#8217;s much more challenging, for sure,&#8221; she said.<\/p>\n<p>But she says if you have a good idea, there\u2019s still money out there. It\u2019s just harder to come by than earlier years. \u201cWhat we hear is great companies will get funded. And the onus is really on founders to lay out a good process, meaning they know what they&#8217;re going to accomplish. They&#8217;re hitting really strong metrics, they built a good team and they&#8217;re solving a problem that has clear customer traction or demand.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2>Boston strengths<\/h2>\n<p>It\u2019s clear Boston\u2019s universities are a unique differentiator over other top startup centers like NYC and SF. These schools, both private and public, act as an engine for ideas and producer of engineering and business talent.<\/p>\n<p>Greg Dracon, a partner at .406 Ventures, a venture capital firm that focuses on Series A investing, says the schools are a huge advantage for Boston.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cBoston&#8217;s always been a great technology town in my opinion, and it&#8217;s hard to beat [all the] colleges and universities with more STEM grads than in any state in the US. So it&#8217;s always been really good at technology,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<p>He says it\u2019s particularly good at cybersecurity with companies with almost 100 startups headquartered in the city, <a href=\"https:\/\/my.pitchbook.com\/search-results\/s255810800\/companies\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">per Pitchbook data<\/a>. Examples of security companies based in the city include <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/12\/12\/snyk-scores-another-196m-as-valuation-drops-12-to-7-4b-valuation\/\">Snyk<\/a>, a late stage startup, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.rapid7.com\/about\/press-releases\/rapid7-announces-closing-of-initial-public-offering\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Rapid7<\/a>, which IPOed in 2015 and <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/08\/22\/vmware-acquires-carbon-black-for-2-1b-and-pivotal-for-2-7-billion\/\">Carbon Black<\/a>, which VMware acquired for $2.1 billion in 2019.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI would argue even in the 2007 timeframe when we started our firm, we specifically focused on things we think Boston excels at.I lead our cybersecurity investing, and I can talk for hours about cybersecurity. If I were to start a cybersecurity company, there&#8217;s no place in the world I would start it other than Boston,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<p>While New York has easy access to Fortune 500 companies, Dracon says Boston is close enough that the distance isn\u2019t appreciable.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cNew York&#8217;s got all these big companies, which is true. But if you&#8217;re building a startup, especially something that sells to enterprise, those are perfect early adopters and proofs of concept. So it&#8217;s a train ride down to get access to any big decision maker,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cYou have the talent in Boston as you start to scale because universities are spitting people out like crazy. And what&#8217;s different today than 2006 when we started the firm is that we now have very big companies that have gone public or were acquired,\u201d he said, noting these large companies and their founders often act as a startup feeder system.<\/p>\n<p>Ajay Agarwal, a partner at Bain Venture Partners, has been investing in startups since 2007, and he says one of Boston\u2019s biggest strengths is in the sciences. We saw Moderna, a Cambridge, Massachusetts pharmaceutical company emerge from relative obscurity in 2021 when it developed an early COVID vaccine.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI think that the Boston scene, first and foremost, has always had incredible strength around hard science\u2026You think about the stuff that Katie Ray is doing at <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/10\/27\/the-engine-fund-two\/\">The Engine<\/a>, the whole world of life sciences \u2013 we have a separate fund here at Bain Capital that&#8217;s focused on life sciences \u2013 and I think the hard sciences, given the MIT roots, have continued to be, a real strength of the city,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<p>Brumme says her firm tries to take advantage of the city\u2019s strengths in terms of the types of startups the accelerator accepts. \u201cWe&#8217;ve been working hard in and around the area of fintech and digital health for long periods of time, given some of the institutional industry leaders that have characterized Boston&#8217;s corporate landscape and are seeing a lot of momentum in those categories,\u201d she said.<\/p>\n<p>She also mentioned robotics, green technologies and what she calls bio-convergence, a cross pollination between robotics and biotech. \u201cIf you think of MIT&#8217;s AI unit coming together with the Broad Institute\u2019s biotech [focus], and just really fascinating companies [are being created] at that intersection of biology and computer science, and we think Boston has a chance to be a real global leader in that adjacent area as well,\u201d she said.<\/p>\n<h2>It\u2019s not for everyone<\/h2>\n<p>Boston clearly has a lot going for it, but it\u2019s not all things to everyone, and the folks we spoke to said for whatever reason, it hasn\u2019t been a great place to start a consumer company. There are exceptions, of course, like Wayfair selling furniture online and Tripadvisor, running a travel site that was launched in the Boston area, but overall it\u2019s not as well suited to consumer technologies.<\/p>\n<p>Dracon thinks that could be because of the deep tech knowledge in the city, again due to the colleges and universities. \u201cIf there&#8217;s one industry that&#8217;s lacking, its consumer, and it kind of goes with the same thing. We&#8217;re an enterprise, deep tech, somewhat risk-averse town. That&#8217;s more of an enterprise-type of product and sale,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<p>Agarwal agrees, saying the city lacks consumer focus for some reason. \u201cI think the city, good or bad, tends to focus on companies that are real, they&#8217;re adding real values that fundamentally have a defensible value proposition,\u201d he said. \u201cConsumer tech is lighter weight technologically under the hood, and is based more on the application or UI design.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe city doesn&#8217;t have a ton of consumer DNA. It&#8217;s never really been the strength of the city,\u201d Agarwal said.<\/p>\n<p>But Boston has had its share of successes over the years with companies like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/katevinton\/2015\/06\/11\/cybersecurity-firm-rapid7-files-for-80-million-ipo\/?sh=67b92ead19df\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Rapid7<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2014\/10\/09\/hubspot-spikes-20-over-its-ipo-price-in-strong-debut\/\">Hubspot<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2014\/10\/13\/wayfair-and-hubspot-ipos-could-be-just-the-beginning-for-boston-startup-scene\/\">Wayfair<\/a> going public in high profile IPOs. There have also been a number of billion dollar acquisitions led by EMC, which was based outside the city and was <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2015\/10\/12\/dell-buys-emc-for-67b-in-largest-deal-in-tech-history\/\">acquired by Dell<\/a> in 2015 for $67 billion, still one of the largest tech acquisitions in history. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1995\/06\/12\/us\/ibm-wins-lotus-as-offer-is-raised-above-3.5-billion.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">IBM acquired Lotus 1-2-3<\/a>, an early spreadsheet company for the PC for $3.5 billion in 1995, VMware bought cybersecurity company <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/08\/22\/vmware-acquires-carbon-black-for-2-1b-and-pivotal-for-2-7-billion\/\">Carbon Black for $2.1 billion <\/a>2019, and Vista Equity Partners <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/09\/24\/vista-equity-partners-buys-acquia-for-1b\/\">bought Acquia<\/a>, the commercial company built on top of the open source Drupal project, for $1 billion also in 2019.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s fair to say that Boston lacks some of the glitz and glamor of other cities, and there has been a history of Yankee frugality, that perhaps has led to a reputation of being risk-averse when it comes to investing in consumer-facing companies. There has also been a tendency to not want to toot its own horn that has allowed Silicon Valley to grab the spotlight and the attention, especially in the \u201890s. Over the last 15 or 20 years, Boston has built an ecosystem to rival Silicon Valley and NYC, making it a place where startups can launch and grow and thrive with a deep pool of talent in their own backyard.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout embed-oembed embed--techcrunch\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"KG5q14EZ2N\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/02\/27\/5-investors-discuss-why-bostons-tech-ecosystem-is-as-resilient-as-they-come\/\">5 investors discuss Boston\u2019s resilient tech ecosystem<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;5 investors discuss Boston\u2019s resilient tech ecosystem&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/02\/27\/5-investors-discuss-why-bostons-tech-ecosystem-is-as-resilient-as-they-come\/embed\/#?secret=T4OIA0oa00#?secret=KG5q14EZ2N\" data-secret=\"KG5q14EZ2N\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<div class=\"embed breakout embed-oembed embed--techcrunch\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"OMyG9KNXwY\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/02\/27\/bostons-university-to-startup-pipeline-defies-downturn-to-grow-and-diversify\/\">Boston&#8217;s university-to-startup pipeline defies downturn to grow and diversify<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Boston&#8217;s university-to-startup pipeline defies downturn to grow and diversify&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/02\/27\/bostons-university-to-startup-pipeline-defies-downturn-to-grow-and-diversify\/embed\/#?secret=QragAO5RkB#?secret=OMyG9KNXwY\" data-secret=\"OMyG9KNXwY\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In order to build a startup culture, a city or region needs some key elements in place \u2013 like an innovation engine to drive startup ideas.

As our very own Brian Heater previously <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/11\/17\/boston-scene-report\/\">noted<\/a>, startups are often located in &#8220;a five- to ten-block radius a stone\u2019s throw from MIT (and, for that matter, Harvard).&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>That also explains why Boston startups are associated with &#8216;tough tech&#8217;. &#8220;Boston, world-class universities and hard tech all go together,&#8221; said Sanjiv Kalevar, a partner at OpenView.<\/p>\n<p>This combination is also arguably what makes Boston more resilient in the current downturn. According to Rudina Seseri, founder and managing partner at Glasswing Ventures, &#8220;Boston remains a vibrant startup and VC market in 2023 [&#8230;] Despite tough markets, a recessionary economy, and overall business pessimism, I am confident Boston will see a new wave of founders starting new companies.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>We spoke with:\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/rudinaseseri\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Rudina Seseri<\/a>, founder and managing partner, <a href=\"https:\/\/glasswing.vc\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Glasswing Ventures<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/lilylyman\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Lily Lyman<\/a>, general partner, <a href=\"https:\/\/underscore.vc\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Underscore VC<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/sanjiv-kalevar\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Sanjiv Kalevar<\/a>, partner, <a href=\"https:\/\/openviewpartners.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">OpenView<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/katierae\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Katie Rae<\/a>, managing partner, <a href=\"https:\/\/engine.xyz\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Engine<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/russ-wilcox-2005\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Russ Wilcox<\/a>, partner, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.pillar.vc\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Pillar VC<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<hr \/>\n<h2>Rudina Seseri, founder and managing partner, Glasswing Ventures<\/h2>\n<p><strong>How would you describe the pace of venture capital dealmaking in Boston this year so far?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Boston remains a vibrant startup and VC market in 2023. The overall pace of funding has declined since 2021, but we are continuing to see high-potential companies and founders secure funding today.<\/p>\n<p>We especially see this in the AI and security markets. Recent data published in the Pitchbook-NVCA Venture Monitor shows that Boston had roughly the same share of the number of VC deals in the U.S. between 2021 and 2022, and we expect that trend to continue or improve in 2023.<\/p>\n<p><strong>For a Boston-based founder, does fundraising in 2023 still involve a lot of Zoom calls? Does it depend on which stage their startup is at?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>We continue to use Zoom calls during our diligence process.

The founder-investor relationship is a lasting one. We enjoy building close bonds with our founders while also giving them the opportunity to meet our building partners.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Have Boston-based tech workers been as affected by layoffs as their peers in the Bay Area?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Every corner of tech has been affected. Yet, despite tough markets, a recessionary economy, and overall business pessimism, I am confident Boston will see a new wave of founders starting new companies.<\/p>\n<p>Innovation shines the brightest in dark times, and it is in these times that transformative ideas are born. Among the technologists laid off from big tech companies recently, we expect many will find a fire in their bellies and build incredible products. Now is an excellent time for early-stage founders to implement their ideas.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Have in-person networking and startup community events in the Boston metropolitan area returned to pre-pandemic levels?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>We have seen the number of events in the broader community tick up and are excited to keep bringing the community together as we head into the spring and summer. We host a wide range of ecosystem events, from networking for the AI and cybersecurity industries, to thought leadership sessions on making your first marketing hire. We will continue to push our ecosystem forward with gatherings at our office in the heart of Back Bay, around the area, or online.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What link do you see, if any, between two of Boston&#8217;s strengths: &#8220;Tough tech&#8221; and university spinouts?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>These are inextricably linked. Boston\u2019s academic rigor is a critical ingredient in delivering the transformative technology that pushes our economy and society forward.<\/p>\n<p>We work very closely with universities and research labs in the area (including, but not limited to, the MIT and Harvard ecosystems) and back leading founders building AI and frontier technology products for the enterprise and security markets.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What\u2019s the most interesting Boston-based company you\u2019ve invested in recently?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>One of our latest investments is in FeatureByte, an AI startup founded by the team that built the backbone for DataRobot. FeatureByte is a platform built specifically for data scientists to simplify the creation, serving, managing and monitoring of machine learning features.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Are you open to cold pitches? How can founders reach you?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Yes, we are open to cold pitches, but prefer warm ones if a founder is able! We are looking for strong founders leveraging AI and frontier technology to build applications and infrastructure for the enterprise and security markets. My email is: rudina@glasswing.vc.<\/p>\n<h2>Lily Lyman, general partner, Underscore VC<\/h2>\n<p><strong>How would you describe the pace of venture capital dealmaking in Boston this year so far?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Looking across the data, it\u2019s clear that the pace of venture dealmaking in Boston slowed in Q3 and Q4 of last year, like everywhere else, as investors and founders were trying to get a sense of the market dynamics.<\/p>\n<p>But thus far in Q1, we are seeing strong, high-quality investment opportunities at the earliest stage. It&#8217;s a great time to invest in early-stage startups. Great founders are starting businesses that are cash-efficient and thinking about business models from Day 1, which helps them attract strong talent at a more affordable rate, face less competition, acquire customers more affordably and solve big problems.<\/p>\n<p>What has changed, particularly at the later stages, are the length and depth of diligence processes. We are no longer seeing the hasty timelines we saw in 2021. Late-stage investors are digging deeper into business fundamentals and projections. Price discovery is harder in this market and late-stage investors are afraid to overpay.<\/p>\n<p><strong>For a Boston-based founder, does fundraising in 2023 still involve a lot of Zoom calls?

And in the more immediate past, layoffs and a capital crunch suggest, if not a bubble about to burst, at least one with an alarming wobble. How have the changes wrought by the pandemic and stuttering economy affected Boston&#8217;s unique ecosystem? Here&#8217;s what leaders of some major Boston outfits had to say about it.<\/p>\n<h2>Embracing entrepreneurship<\/h2>\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve seen an extraordinary rise of entrepreneurship focused programs,&#8221; said Cait Brumme, CEO of nonprofit startup community <a href=\"https:\/\/masschallenge.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">MassChallenge<\/a>. &#8220;Tufts, Brandeis, Boston [University], UMass, all these universities now have entrepreneurship programs, incubators, on campus accelerators that are often included in the curriculum.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Some of that has been just in the last few years. In 2019, <a href=\"https:\/\/innovationlabs.harvard.edu\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Harvard Innovation Labs<\/a> was tracking 93 concurrent ventures at the school.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re at 673 now,&#8221; said executive director Matt Segneri. &#8220;There&#8217;s been a significant increase in students interested in this work; business, law, design, we&#8217;ve seen a representative pie of all of those. Edtech, climate, digital health and biotech, and enterprise have also seen a big uptick.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Segneri also described crossover work between domains, with consumer-facing rather than therapeutic applications.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2488480\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2488480\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2488480\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/brumme-segneri.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"512\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/brumme-segneri.jpg 2500w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/brumme-segneri.jpg?resize=150,75 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/brumme-segneri.jpg?resize=300,150 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/brumme-segneri.jpg?resize=768,384 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/brumme-segneri.jpg?resize=680,340 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/brumme-segneri.jpg?resize=1536,768 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/brumme-segneri.jpg?resize=2048,1024 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/brumme-segneri.jpg?resize=1200,600 1200w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/brumme-segneri.jpg?resize=50,25 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2488480\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Cait Brumme of MassChallenge, left, and Harvard Innovation Labs&#8217; Matt Segneri.<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>Pillar VC principal and co-founder of Petri <a href=\"https:\/\/www.pillar.vc\/team\/tony-kulesa\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Tony Kulesa<\/a> echoed that, saying &#8220;we&#8217;ve seen significant exploration of fields outside of therapeutics, bioengineering broadly applied. We are seeing an explosion of entrepreneurs applying bioengineering technology to public health, climate biotech, food, agriculture, and sustainability.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The shift to remote work and learning has had unpredictable aspects across nearly every industry and segment of society. In the case of student entrepreneurship it seems to have supercharged the community, says <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2016\/06\/17\/devolver-digital-co-founder-mike-wilson-on-becoming-the-sub-pop-for-games\/\">Subaita Rahman<\/a>, a student and entrepreneur herself who has participated in startup scenes in Boston, Toronto, and beyond.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I really think the pandemic increased and accelerated young people getting in earlier, because everything went remote,&#8221; explained Rahman, who is currently spending her gap year working at Boston&#8217;s Pillar VC. &#8220;That really changed things because you can find that environment anywhere you go. There&#8217;s also hacker houses popping up everywhere you go, and founders wanting to give back to their communities. Knowledge is being democratized, it&#8217;s all out there after years of people trying and failing, in tech and bio and crypto. It&#8217;s all just unfolding on the internet.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Segneri said that this trend is noticeable at Harvard, where entrepreneurship is becoming a more common skill for students to want to cultivate.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;There are more folks coming into these programs who already have entrepreneurial experience \u2014 there are college freshmen who already have startup experience,&#8221; he said. &#8220;There are more people who are orienting to their degree program with entrepreneur experience, and we&#8217;re trying to meet people where they are.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2488479\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2488479\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2488479\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/rahman-kulesa.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"511\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/rahman-kulesa.jpg 2025w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/rahman-kulesa.jpg?resize=150,75 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/rahman-kulesa.jpg?resize=300,150 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/rahman-kulesa.jpg?resize=768,383 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/rahman-kulesa.jpg?resize=680,339 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/rahman-kulesa.jpg?resize=1536,766 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/rahman-kulesa.jpg?resize=1200,599 1200w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/rahman-kulesa.jpg?resize=50,25 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2488479\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Subaita Rahman and Tony Kulesa of Pillar Venture Capital.<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>But the trend reaches beyond the student body: Kulesa described increased interest across the board \u2014 a migration, even, especially compared to the relatively insular academic community of just a decade ago.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The most prominent change is the level of interest among academics \u2014 both grad students and faculty \u2014 in startups, with many even leaving academia to start and run companies. For example, consider these faculty that left academia to start companies: Daphne Koller of insitro, Andy Beck of PathAI, Sri Kosuri of Octant,&#8221; he wrote in an email. &#8220;This year for the first time, ~50% of graduating PhDs want to enter industry rather than remaining in academia.&#8221;<\/p>\n<h2>Learning and doing<\/h2>\n<p>In the undergrad world, it&#8217;s not just about learning Business Management 101, though. As Brumme points out, entrepreneurship involves more than that.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s building in the notion of entrepreneurship as a professional skill: not just the founder as entrepreneur, but all of us as entrepreneurs in our own organizations,&#8221; she said.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The education mission is essential,&#8221; Segneri said, and commercial success isn&#8217;t always the outcome or even goal. &#8220;For people just dabbling in this work, what they&#8217;re learning is not just how to build a company \u2014 they&#8217;re learning hypothesis testing, learning by doing. Applying what they&#8217;re learning in coursework to entrepreneurial work is a way to take that project-based learning into an impact space.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>A side effect of integrating startup lessons into classes is that these skills don&#8217;t need to be addressed remedially at the moment someone decides they&#8217;d like to start a company.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;And as more institutions engage in that early stage, it has allowed us to reduce our emphasis on classic curriculum and increase our emphasis on having a strong network,&#8221; said Brumme.<\/p>\n<p>Segneri described the network side of things as &#8220;turning entrepreneurship from a solo sport into a rich community of founders.&#8221; Rahman seemed to concur, while also noting that the community reaches between institutions as well as within them.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;All these great universities are so close to each other and they collaborate so much \u2014 that&#8217;s the key to why Boston is in such a good place,&#8221; she said. &#8220;There are great people everywhere, not just your alma mater. I found value speaking with people my age, who were more like me, even if they were in different places. It&#8217;s always nice to speak with people with wildly different perspectives.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>She also found it a bit funny that, as universities have been working to recreate the tech startup world, &#8220;tech has been trying to recreate university, in a way, with hacker houses and stuff \u2014 they&#8217;re basically dorms, but more curated.&#8221; Clearly the collaborative atmosphere of idealistic, early-stage founders is a valuable resource.<\/p>\n<h2>Finding the right partner<\/h2>\n<p>In fact, it can be valuable enough that one perceives a risk of exploitation. Students are, of course, coming to university to learn, and that needs to be balanced with the siren song of startup millions.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;It reminds me a bit of paid sponsorship for athletes,&#8221; mused Brumme. &#8220;On one hand, you could say that allowing students access to resources to grow their businesses before graduating provides them value and runway, but does it detract from the core purposes of going to school?&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2488485\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2488485\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2488485\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/masschal.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"580\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/masschal.jpg 1486w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/masschal.jpg?resize=150,85 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/masschal.jpg?resize=300,170 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/masschal.jpg?resize=768,435 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/masschal.jpg?resize=680,385 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/masschal.jpg?resize=1200,680 1200w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/masschal.jpg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2488485\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photos from MassChallenge&#8217;s various events.<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>As young and inexperienced founders, they are also vulnerable to mistakes like trading away too much equity or succumbing to investor pressure. That&#8217;s the exception rather than the rule, but one it pays to be aware of.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;No one is insulated from this current environment, but we think the Boston seed and pre-seed system has held up pretty well. We&#8217;ve seen experiments from venture firms doing scout programs. Flybridge <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bizjournals.com\/boston\/inno\/stories\/news\/2019\/03\/19\/exclusive-flybridge-capital-launches-graduate.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">launched a student first fund<\/a> this year focused on Harvard. We saw that with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bizjournals.com\/boston\/inno\/stories\/news\/2019\/03\/19\/exclusive-flybridge-capital-launches-graduate.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Dorm Room Fund<\/a> and First Round Capital,&#8221; Brumme continued. &#8220;Startups would say it&#8217;s really hard to raise funding still, and we work on getting them access to non-dilutive options. VC is a very powerful partner for the right moment in time, but it is not the right mechanism or option for all founders, especially early ones. 25-30 percent of the companies we back intend to bootstrap as long as they can.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;There are a bunch of new funding mechanisms coming online,&#8221; said Kulesa, naming Convergent Research, Arc Institute, Fast Grants, and Homeworld as organizations changing research funding models. VC is adapting too; Pillar is working directly with the student-led non-profit incubator Nucleate to find and fund university spinoffs.<\/p>\n<p>Rahman warned, however, of biting off more than you can chew as a student founder.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;You have to know your own limits. Some people can full-on drop out and make this company, they&#8217;re the only one who can do it. But you have to realize that you&#8217;re young and you have to make a lot of mistakes,&#8221; said Rahman. &#8220;And I mean, if you&#8217;re under 25, your brain isn&#8217;t even fully developed yet! It&#8217;s not just about age either, it&#8217;s any first time founder.&#8221;<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout embed-oembed embed--techcrunch\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"kXcOtM3wOD\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/11\/29\/early-stage-founders-still-have-currency-fundraising-in-times-of-greater-vc-scrutiny\/\">Early-stage founders still have currency: Fundraising in times of greater VC scrutiny<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Early-stage founders still have currency: Fundraising in times of greater VC scrutiny&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/11\/29\/early-stage-founders-still-have-currency-fundraising-in-times-of-greater-vc-scrutiny\/embed\/#?secret=ivRM2IKZAB#?secret=kXcOtM3wOD\" data-secret=\"kXcOtM3wOD\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>Kulesa recommended that any first-time founders do some real research before accepting investment.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The best I can recommend is to be educated,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We put tons of resources online that include how to negotiate a term sheet and a term sheet grader, and there is a plethora of stuff out there from others as well. That being said, I think trust and shared vision\/values is the most important thing. We always offer to buy common stock in rounds that we lead for this reason &#8212; we believe if we have the same economics as founders it leads to trust and alignment.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Segneri was careful to clarify that although HIL does promote the companies going through it, they are in service to the students, not investors or any other interested parties.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We will do demo days, so we are in that sense an intermediary, escalating certain student pitches to venture firms,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But what we center in all of it is the best interests of these students. We don&#8217;t typically have corporate partners. We&#8217;re largely supporting students launching or building their own thing.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>While everyone agreed that more resources and support are a good thing for student founders, Rahman had the most practical idea for improving the ecosystem.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I think microgrants would be super helpful,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Getting money to travel to places for conferences, to take the chance to do an internship. Not everyone is able to afford San Francisco rents. Even a thousand or two thousand can change someone&#8217;s life&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s hard, to balance your ambitions with being young, and just being a college kid. but I think you can do both,&#8221; she concluded. &#8220;It can be quite difficult to find people who are as ambitious and curious, who are dropping out and exploring things \u2014 it can be isolating and lonely. You might fail, you might fail badly \u2014 and that&#8217;s OK. That&#8217;s the best expectation to have.

The date, marking the release of the first Pok\u00e9mon games in Japan in 1996, now serves as an opportunity for the mega-franchise to share what&#8217;s fans can look forward to over the next year.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Pok\u00e9mon Concierge&#8221; is produced in collaboration with Dwarf Animation Studio. In the brief preview, fans saw a Psyduck waddling along a beach &#8212; a Japanese-language voiceover explains that Pok\u00e9mon are the guests at this resort. Though we didn&#8217;t see any other Pok\u00e9mon, a hyperrealistic, 3D Pikachu sat beside Pok\u00e9mon Company president Tsunekazu Ishihara as he opened the stream. Some fans thought this was a nod to an announcement about another &#8220;Detective Pikachu&#8221; movie, but it seems more likely that this was connected to the Netflix news.<\/p>\n<p>The Pok\u00e9mon Company and Netflix did not share details about when the series will premiere. Currently, Netflix viewers can watch the longtime Pok\u00e9mon anime series.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout embed-oembed embed--techcrunch\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"wW5zbIfbBy\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/02\/08\/netflix-starts-cracking-down-on-password-sharing-in-four-new-markets-including-canada\/\">Netflix starts cracking down on password sharing in four new markets, including Canada<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute;

That&#8217;s where we come in.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Spade is now buoyed by $5 million in seed funding, led by Andreessen Horowitz. Joining in on the round were Y Combinator, Gradient Ventures, Dash Fund and a group of angel investors from Square, Alloy, Coinbase, MANTL and Venmo. In total, the company raised $6.1 million.<\/p>\n<p>MacTavish intends to deploy much of the funds into hiring \u2014 until recently it was just him and Hart, but now there are 10 people on the team. The company also has a lot of runway now to purchase and negotiate data acquisition deals, he said.<\/p>\n<p>MacTavish said Spade is bringing in revenue, but declined to comment further than to say the company \u201chad our biggest quarter ever in the first quarter\u201d of this year after launching its card issuer products last October. He also offered that the company is now more focused on growing revenue now that it has gotten to a good place with its product. Their current customer base includes Unit, Solid, Yotta, Daylight, Ness and Coast.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe&#8217;re at a really strong place in terms of product and we&#8217;re very confident we have the team to scale,\u201d MacTavish added. \u201cHistorically, we&#8217;ve worked with mid-market and startups, but we&#8217;re really pushing off towards the mid-market and then on the enterprise side as well. Once we land a few more marquee customers we can sort of get that next stage of growth.\u201d<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout embed-oembed embed--techcrunch\">\n<blockquote

very short order, we\u2019ve moved away from a \u201cgrowth over everything\u201d mentality to one that focuses on operational efficiency, and this is true for startups and mature companies alike.<\/p>\n<p>In truth, though, the shift probably happened slowly over time as the economy got shakier (or at least a growing <em>belief<\/em> that it was shakier) and companies decided to tighten the purse strings.<\/p>\n<p>We\u2019ve seen this play out in a number of ways. The most visible is the constant onslaught of tech layoffs in recent months, with <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/01\/18\/microsoft-announces-10000-job-cuts-nearly-5-of-its-workforce\/\">Microsoft<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/01\/20\/google-parent-alphabet-cuts-6-of-its-workforce-impacting-12000-people\/\">Alphabet<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/01\/05\/amazon-to-cut-18000-jobs-as-tech-layoffs-continue\/\">Amazon<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/01\/04\/salesforce-to-cut-workforce-by-10-after-hiring-too-many-people-during-the-pandemic\/\">Salesforce<\/a> all announcing big staff reductions. While the pace seems to have slowed some in February, more than <a href=\"https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/world\/us\/us-layoffs-hit-two-year-high-jan-tech-slashed-thousands-jobs-report-2023-02-02\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">100,000 people<\/a> were let go in January in a massive tech company purge.<\/p>\n<p>Even though companies clearly overhired during the height of the pandemic, and there are still plenty of <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/02\/16\/jobs-layoffs-big-tech\/\">open tech jobs<\/a>, the message is clear that cost cutting is taking precedence over growth investments.<\/p>\n<p>We have even seen <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/02\/06\/even-as-cloud-infrastructure-market-growth-slows-microsoft-continues-to-gain-on-amazon\/\">cloud infrastructure spending<\/a> take a hit, an area that has been in constant growth mode for years. But things began to slow down in a big way at the end of last year, and AWS reported at its most recent earnings call that it was seeing growth <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/02\/03\/aws-says-growth-dropped-to-mid-teens-to-start-new-year-as-customer-cost-cutting-continues\/\">drop into the teens<\/a> in January.<\/p>\n<p>As we reported at the end of the year, companies <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/12\/12\/all-signs-point-to-it-spending-rising-in-2023\/\">are still spending<\/a> on tech, but they are looking at their expenditures much more closely. CIOs we spoke to were all taking a more controlled kind of growth, where each dollar spent is facing much more scrutiny.<\/p>\n<p>They don\u2019t want to shut the door on growth, but they want to look at things like operational efficiency and cutting back without adversely affecting the company\u2019s core priorities.<\/p>\n<p>The big question is how they do that, and do the financials suggest that they\u2019re successfully balancing what could be seen as conflicting priorities between growth and efficiency?<\/p>\n<h2>What CIOs are saying<\/h2>\n<p>The CIOs we spoke to certainly recognize there has been a shift, and as they look at their budget priorities, they want to be smart about spending. They all said they want to look at efficiencies where it makes sense, with the understanding that the tech budget drives growth, and you don\u2019t want to overcorrect when it comes to budgeting.<\/p>\n<p><div class=\"extra-crunch-offer-container\"><\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It&#8217;s clear that companies are scrutinizing spending more, but that

It&#8217;s safe to say the automaker packed a lot of news into the day-long affair.<\/p>\n<p>Where do I begin? How about the future tech foundation of its vehicles. I&#8217;m talking about <a href=\"https:\/\/media.mercedes-benz.com\/2023-mercedes-benz-operating-system\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>MB.OS<\/strong><\/a>, an operating system that Mercedes has been working on for years now. The operating system will debut in its next-generation of vehicles expected to go into production by mid decade.<\/p>\n<p>Mercedes is not going it alone, however. MB.OS, which is designed to be more efficient and use fewer ECUs, will also leverage tech from partners like <strong>Google<\/strong>, <strong>Luminar<\/strong> and <strong>Nvidia<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\"><strong>Mercedes-Benz<\/strong> and <strong>Google<\/strong> announced a <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/02\/22\/mercedes-google-maps-youtube\/\">long-term partnership<\/a> that appears to strike a Goldilocks-type balance between offering the Google services consumers want without ceding control over the entire operating system in the car. Specifically, Mercedes is tapping Google for its Maps, Cloud and the YouTube app.<\/p>\n<p>Mercedes also announced plans <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/02\/22\/mercedes-adding-luminar-lidar-to-more-vehicles-in-multibillion-dollar-deal\/\">to expand<\/a> a rather new relationship with lidar company Luminar and provided an update on its partnership with Nvidia.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>And the news didn&#8217;t stop there. The company revealed the interior of the upcoming Mercedes E Class, which includes the next-generation MBUX infotainment system that it described as a pre-cursor to MB.OS. The newly updated MBUX system will feature a \u201csuperscreen\u201d that spans the entire dashboard and will feature a bunch of third-party apps including <strong>TikTok<\/strong>, <strong>Zoom<\/strong> video conferencing, <strong>Angry Birds<\/strong>, <strong>Vivaldi<\/strong> web browser and <strong>Webex<\/strong> by Cisco apps.<\/p>\n<p>Drivers won&#8217;t have access to the apps while the vehicle is moving. However, it is expected that the automaker&#8217;s conditional automated driving system called Drive Pilot, which allows for hands off, eyes-off driving in certain conditions on highways, will make its way to the E Class when it goes on sale this fall. If that&#8217;s the case, well then, those apps would be available.<\/p>\n<p>Last item: I sat in the passenger seat for a test &#8220;ride&#8221; of the Drive Pilot system on a highway in California. The hands-off, eyes-off system was impressive in terms of performance, staying within the lane, making automated lane changes and the style of driving (not too passive, not too aggressive).<\/p>\n<p>Notably, though is HOW the vehicle communicates to the driver when it&#8217;s time to take over or if the driver is not following the rules. The driver-monitor system is on it!

Wiz today announced that it raised $300 million in a Series D round led by Lightspeed Venture Partners with participation from Greenoaks Capital Partners and angel investors including Starbucks owner Howard Schultz and French business magnate Bernard Arnault, valuing Wiz at around $10 billion post-money.<\/p>\n<p>Bringing its funding to nearly $1 billion ($900 million), CEO Rappaport says the new cash will be put toward product development and hiring well into the new year. &#8220;When we first launched Wiz, we set out to design a product with the world\u2019s leading enterprises in mind, and all the complexity and operational considerations their dynamic cloud environments present,&#8221; he told TechCrunch in an email interview. &#8220;With Wiz, companies are developing a new maturity level in their cloud environments by improving security, increasing visibility and driving agility.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Explosive&#8221; is the right word. Wiz&#8217;s success in securing financing is impressive considering that startups are increasingly failing to command the <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/01\/18\/losing-the-horn-vcs-think-majority-of-unicorns-arent-worth-1-billion-anymore\/\">high valuations<\/a> that were common in past years. As per the aforementioned Momentum Cyber report, the value of deals in the cybersecurity sector in 2022 dropped by more than a quarter versus 2021. PitchBook <a href=\"https:\/\/siliconangle.com\/2022\/08\/02\/vc-investment-early-stage-cybersecurity-startups-slows-second-quarter\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">data<\/a> shows a decline in cybersecurity valuations at the seed and Series A stages in particular.<\/p>\n<p>New York-based Wiz &#8212; which claims that it&#8217;s the world&#8217;s largest cybersecurity unicorn and the fastest software-as-a-service company to achieve a $10 billion valuation &#8212; was founded in March 2020. The initial team worked together for over 20 years including as Microsoft&#8217;s cloud security group leads and as the co-founders of enterprise cybersecurity firm Adallom, which was acquired by Microsoft for $320 million.<\/p>\n<p>Rappaport was the previously the GM at Microsoft&#8217;s Israel R&amp;D department, where Luttwak was the CTO. Costica, for his part, was the partner director of product management at Microsoft&#8217;s cloud security division.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2491239\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2491239\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2491239\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/1659991172-screen-shot-2022-08-08-at-1-39-05-pm.png\" alt=\"Wiz\" width=\"1024\" height=\"582\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/1659991172-screen-shot-2022-08-08-at-1-39-05-pm.png 3024w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/1659991172-screen-shot-2022-08-08-at-1-39-05-pm.png?resize=150,85 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/1659991172-screen-shot-2022-08-08-at-1-39-05-pm.png?resize=300,170 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/1659991172-screen-shot-2022-08-08-at-1-39-05-pm.png?resize=768,436 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/1659991172-screen-shot-2022-08-08-at-1-39-05-pm.png?resize=680,386 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/1659991172-screen-shot-2022-08-08-at-1-39-05-pm.png?resize=1536,873 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/1659991172-screen-shot-2022-08-08-at-1-39-05-pm.png?resize=2048,1164 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/1659991172-screen-shot-2022-08-08-at-1-39-05-pm.png?resize=1200,682 1200w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/1659991172-screen-shot-2022-08-08-at-1-39-05-pm.png?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2491239\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Wiz&#8217;s cloud dashboard, which offers a range of configuration options.<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>Rappaport, Luttwak and Costica <span style=\"font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">worked alongside Reznik at Adallom, and all joined Microsoft after the acquisition.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Wiz, like other cloud security platforms, analyzes infrastructure hosted in public cloud services such as AWS, Azure, Google Cloud and more for risk factors that could allow hackers to gain control of assets and obtain sensitive customer data. The company maintains a &#8220;security graph&#8221; that correlates information across the different areas that a company&#8217;s trying to protect, whether that\u2019s the network, identity, secrets or workloads.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;This new approach to cloud security disrupts the agent-based security model and utilizes an agentless, API-centered approach to seamlessly scan cloud workloads,&#8221; Rappaport said. &#8220;Wiz said goodbye to contextless alerts and, instead, at the heart of the product lies the Wiz security graph.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>By showing these correlations, Wiz argues that it can help plug security holes and find issues much faster than rival solutions.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Wiz shows every C-level the risk level of each application running in their cloud,&#8221; Rappaport continued. &#8220;The risk alerts are actionable, allowing developers to focus on fixing the critical most issues and for managers to understand their risk across the different teams and apps.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s a lot to promise, though &#8212; particularly in light of just how large and diverse the market for cloud security solutions is today. <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/01\/31\/sentra-raises-30m-to-provide-a-security-layer-for-data-in-the-cloud\/\">Sentra<\/a>, which finds data in the cloud and offers remediation plans for data security teams, raised $30 million in January. Cloud infrastructure security startup <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/02\/01\/gem-security-wants-to-secure-your-cloud-infrastructure-raises-11m\/\">Gem Security<\/a> landed $11 million in February. There&#8217;s also <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/09\/14\/dig-scoops-up-34m-to-tackle-the-fragmented-world-of-cloud-data-security\/\">Dig Security<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/11\/17\/public-cloud-security-startup-laminar-emerges-from-stealth-with-37m\/\">Laminar<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/09\/13\/opus-security-emerges-from-stealth-to-help-tackle-cloud-security-threats\/\">Opus Security<\/a> &#8212; cloud security orchestration and remediation platforms that have between them raised tens of millions of dollars in capital.<\/p>\n<p>Beyond the uptick in breaches, the widespread move to the cloud is motivating the fundraising and market expansion. A 2021 <a href=\"https:\/\/get.oreilly.com\/ind_the-cloud-in-2021-adoption-continues.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">survey<\/a> from O\u2019Reilly shows that cloud adoption is steadily rising across industries, with 90% of organizations now using cloud computing &#8212; up from 88% in 2020. A separate <a href=\"https:\/\/www.zdnet.com\/article\/report-wheres-the-value-from-cloud-investments\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">report<\/a> from PwC finds that 74% of executives are deeply involved in cloud strategy, with 70% saying they&#8217;re making cloud-related talent and upskilling decisions.<\/p>\n<p>Very predictably, cloud adoption has opened up companies to risks that they didn&#8217;t necessarily anticipate. In its 2022 <a href=\"https:\/\/www.businesswire.com\/news\/home\/20220713005142\/en\/New-Cloud-Security-Alliance-Survey-Finds-67-of-Organizations-Already-Store-Sensitive-Data-in-Public-Cloud-Environments\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">poll<\/a>, the Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) revealed that 67% of organizations store sensitive data in public cloud environments. And <a href=\"https:\/\/cloudsecurityalliance.org\/press-releases\/2021\/03\/30\/cloud-security-alliance-releases-latest-survey-report-on-state-of-cloud-security-concerns-challenges-and-incidents\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">according<\/a> to the CSA&#8217;s poll from the previous year, cloud issues and misconfigurations &#8212; including cloud provider issues and security misconfigurations &#8212; are the leading causes of data breaches and outages.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Cloud is the biggest transformation to InfoSec since inception, changing the way organizations deliver and ship software,&#8221; Rappaport said. &#8220;Cloud development is decentralized by nature, with decentralized infrastructure and development, and enabling organizations to build faster than ever before. Security organizations need to change their operation model to support the dynamic and decentralized nature of cloud, and address the unique challenges cloud presents around exposure and pace of changes and attacks.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Wiz&#8217;s product sort of sells itself, then. In fact, Wiz claims to be the <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/08\/10\/cloud-security-startup-wiz-reaches-100m-arr-in-just-18-months\/\">fastest company ever<\/a> to $100 million in annual recurring revenue (ARR), scaling from $1 million to $100 million in ARR in just over 18 months (from February 2021 to approximately July 2022). The company now counts 45% of the Fortune 100 among its customer base, including BMW, Morgan Stanley, Salesforce, Slack, Colgate and Blackstone.<\/p>\n<p>To accommodate the growth, Wiz has invested heavily in hiring, expanding its workforce from roughly 500 in summer 2022 to 650 today across offices in Austin, Dallas and Washington, D.C. Short of an IPO, the plan is to double Wiz&#8217;s workforce by the end of the year and continue growing in the U.S., Rappaport says, including public agencies within the federal government. (The office in Washington, D.C. is no doubt a part of that plan.)<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Wiz is rapidly becoming the center of the cloud security ecosystem,&#8221; Patrick Backhouse, a partner at Greenoaks, said in a press release. &#8220;Just two years ago, securing the cloud environment meant relying on a scattered collection of point solutions and add-ons. But today, Wiz has built a comprehensive cloud-native platform that gives customers actionable insights within minutes, showing them their areas of vulnerability, the risks they face, and how to resolve them. We rarely see a business gain traction or garner customer love so quickly, and we are thrilled to partner with Assaf and his team as they pursue the next chapter in their journey.&#8221;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Cybersecurity continues to be a major area for investment among businesses &#8212; and VCs.

href=\"https:\/\/www.statista.com\/outlook\/dmo\/fintech\/digital-payments\/worldwide\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">expected<\/a> to reach $14.79 trillion by 2027, payment infrastructure has arguably never been more critical. But at the same time the tech is becoming essential, the costs and complexities associated with it are increasing. One recent survey shows that merchants&#8217; satisfaction with their payment processors has declined <a href=\"https:\/\/www.retaildive.com\/news\/merchants-fees-tech-issues-payments-msp-processing-bank-of-america-square-paysafe\/641984\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">massively<\/a>, particularly when major technical hurdles arise.<\/p>\n<p>Seeking to find solutions to these problems, Klas B\u00e4ck, Albert Drouart and Dan Blomberg founded <a href=\"https:\/\/pagos.ai\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Pagos<\/a>, a &#8220;payment intelligence&#8221; infrastructure startup. Made up of payment experts with backgrounds from Braintree, PayPal and Stripe, Pagos turns disparate digital payments data into actionable insights without requiring customers to change their payment processors.<\/p>\n<p>CEO B\u00e4ck and Drouart held senior leadership positions at Braintree\/Venmo and PayPal over the last eight to nine years; Braintree\/Venmo was acquired by PayPal in September 2013. Blomberg, for his part, has launched seven startups and sold five over the last two decades.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Payment processing is fundamental to customer relationships, revenue and a business\u2019s bottom line, but is getting more and more complex to manage well,&#8221; B\u00e4ck told TechCrunch via email. &#8220;Most companies don\u2019t have the tools, data, or knowledge to develop or execute on an effective payment strategy; even those that do often leave significant opportunities on the table. Pagos was founded on the principle that almost all companies need help to be more data driven around their payment execution.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Payments infrastructure vendors aren&#8217;t exactly a dime a dozen, but there&#8217;s a growing amount chasing after the massive market opportunity. <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/04\/27\/ex-chime-engineers-raise-4m-for-b2b-payments-startup-streamlined\/\">Streamline<\/a>, headquartered in San Francisco, recently raised $4 million for its business-to-business-focused payments product suite. <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/06\/07\/ecuadorian-payments-infrastructure-startup-kushki-lands-100m-at-a-1-5b-valuation\/\">Kushki<\/a> is a much larger player &#8212; the Ecuadorian payments infrastructure startup landed $100 million last year at a $1.5 billion valuation.<\/p>\n<p>So what does Pagos bring to the table? B\u00e4ck claims that it uniquely allows companies to stream and store their payments data &#8212; including commerce and fraud data &#8212; in one place. From a single dashboard, customers can visualize the data and keep track of metrics, including transaction, payment authorization and risk performance.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2490455\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2490455\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2490455\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/Pagos-Homepage-Dashboards-final.webp\" alt=\"Pagos\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/Pagos-Homepage-Dashboards-final.webp 1220w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/Pagos-Homepage-Dashboards-final.webp?resize=150,84 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/Pagos-Homepage-Dashboards-final.webp?resize=300,169 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/Pagos-Homepage-Dashboards-final.webp?resize=768,432 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/Pagos-Homepage-Dashboards-final.webp?resize=680,382 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/Pagos-Homepage-Dashboards-final.webp?resize=1200,675 1200w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/Pagos-Homepage-Dashboards-final.webp?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2490455\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Pagos&#8217; financial monitoring dashboard. <strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Pagos<\/p><\/div><\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Pagos offers connections to payment processors such as Adyen, Chase, Braintree, PayPal, Stripe and WorldPay, as well as data ingestion APIs so that businesses can stream payments data and custom metadata into the platform.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Our action products bring together a company\u2019s data and provide APIs to give developers and business stakeholders in a company the ability to build more sophistication in their payment stack to address issues such as churn, risk, and cost &#8212; ask Pagos for recommendations on what credentials, where, and how to send your transactions for maximum upside,&#8221; B\u00e4ck said. &#8220;Pagos is different because we are not trying to offer new plumbing; we want them to use the collection of vendors and partners they have better, which could include changing processes and systems to address issues.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>In terms of customers, B\u00e4ck says that Pagos, whose platform has processed over a billion transaction events, is focused on companies that sell or bill their customers online as well as firms that service them, like fraud providers, payment orchestration platforms, acquirers, payment service providers, vertical software-as-a-service companies and marketplaces. Current clients include Adobe, Eventbrite, GoFundMe, Peek and Warner Bros Discover.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Pagos allows businesses to see what&#8217;s going on inside a payments stack,&#8221; B\u00e4ck said. &#8220;Use cases include adding new payment partners and payment method, identifying optimal payment methods and routes, tracking payments and chargeback metrics and optimizing recurring billing to reduce churn.<\/p>\n<p>Some investors see the value proposition. Pagos today closed a $34 million Series A round led by Arbor Ventures with participation from Infinity Ventures, Underscore VC and Point 72 Ventures. It brings the company&#8217;s total raised to $44 million, which B\u00e4ck says is being put toward funding new hires in engineering, product development and &#8220;faster customer implementation.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We actually weren\u2019t seeking additional capital right now. However, we were flooded with inbound investor interest and recognized a unique opportunity to scale our customer base even faster, especially in today\u2019s volatile economic climate,&#8221; B\u00e4ck said. &#8220;This opportunistic Series A round was substantially oversubscribed.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>As for what the future holds, B\u00e4ck says he isn&#8217;t too concerned about the challenging macroeconomic climate for startups.

href=\"https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/business\/private-equity-firms-pounce-take-companies-private-2022-07-21\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">spent a record $226.5 billion<\/a> on take-private transactions globally in the first half of 2022, which is 39% higher than the same period in 2021. While overall mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A) activity slowed significantly in the second half of last year with equity market volatility, the volume of large acquisitions by PE firms looking to capitalize on a period of lowered valuation expectations is rebounding as a result of bottoming valuations and a large supply of public company targets.<\/p>\n<p>When public companies underperform, PE firms in pursuit of equity value creation opportunities are eager to purchase and take these organizations private.<\/p>\n<p>Despite economic cycle peaks and troughs, these types of transactions represent a large and growing share of overall M&amp;A activity. With this growth in the volume of PE-backed transactions, it\u2019s increasingly important to understand the basics of these transactions and the potential implications on key stakeholders, including customers, partners and employees of the acquired company, in particular, those who are left to wonder how the acquisition will affect them.<\/p>\n<h2>Why do PE firms purchase publicly traded companies to take them private?<\/h2>\n<p>PE firms are investment funds that specialize in buying underperforming businesses with the goal of fixing performance and selling the business later for a profit. While PE firms can also buy private companies or take minority ownership stakes in businesses, their traditional approach has most often been to acquire publicly traded companies and take them private.<\/p>\n<p>The software industry has seen significant take-private activity in the last year &#8212; Coupa, Citrix, Anaplan, Zendesk, Duck Creek and more &#8212; and the volume of such transactions is likely to increase given many newly public software companies (those listed in the last three to four years) are trading below their IPO valuations.<\/p>\n<p>There are many reasons a PE firm chooses to buy a publicly traded company. The most common return on investment drivers (which by no means are mutually exclusive) are to significantly improve cash flows from operations, fix the company\u2019s business operations and take advantage of untapped growth opportunities.<\/p>\n<h2>What happens after an acquisition is announced?<\/h2>\n<p>After the buyout agreement is signed and publicly announced, typically a deal will go into a multimonth pre-closing period while regulatory approvals are processed, debt financing is raised and closing conditions are satisfied. During this pre-closing period, the management of the acquired business generally freezes new investments, which often includes reduced hiring and the transition to near-term cost-rationalization.<\/p>\n<p>The new PE owner will use this time to firm up its plans to shift short and long-term focus, including weighing the depth and breadth of cost cuts, changes to business practices and operations and defining new strategic priorities. Unfortunately, these pauses and changes create significant uncertainty and disruption for key stakeholders, especially employees and customers.<\/p>\n<h2>What happens after the multimonth pre-closing period?<\/h2>\n<p>Once all approvals and closing conditions are satisfied, the acquisition will close. The company will be de-listed and the PE firm officially owns the company. Most PE firms have a playbook for optimizing the operations of newly acquired companies and will begin to rapidly implement those strategies. Common changes include new leadership and corporate strategy reflective of the PE firm\u2019s long-term experience managing through economic cycles and industry-specific market nuances.<\/p>\n<p><div

But late last year, the company launched a closed beta for an AI system, called <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/01\/09\/anthropics-claude-improves-on-chatgpt-but-still-suffers-from-limitations\/\">Claude<\/a>, similar to OpenAI\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/tag\/chatgpt\/\">ChatGPT<\/a> that appeared to improve upon the original in key ways. Claude was created using a technique Anthropic developed called &#8220;constitutional AI,&#8221; which aims to provide a &#8220;principle-based&#8221; approach to aligning AI systems with human intentions &#8212; letting AI similar to ChatGPT respond to questions using a simple set of principles (e.g. avoid giving harmful advice) as a guide.<\/p>\n<p>Preliminary impressions of Claude were good. But like ChatGPT, the system suffered from limitations, like giving dangerous answers to questions (e.g. how to make meth at home) and making inconsistent, factually wrong statements.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>It&#8217;s unclear whether the model Robin&#8217;s using\u00a0<em>is<\/em> Claude or some derivative &#8212; neither Robin nor Anthropic would say. And even after repeated prodding, Anthropic wouldn&#8217;t reveal how many partners it&#8217;s currently working (or how they came to work with them) with and how many models it plans to open up to commercial usage.<\/p>\n<p>But no doubt, Anthropic is feeling some sort of pressure from investors to recoup the hundreds of millions of dollars that&#8217;ve been put toward its AI tech.<\/p>\n<p>Most recently, Google pledged $300 million in Anthropic for a 10% stake in the startup. Under the terms of the deal, which was first <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ft.com\/content\/583ead66-467c-4bd5-84d0-ed5df7b5bf9c\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">reported<\/a> by the Financial Times, Anthropic agreed to make Google Cloud its &#8220;preferred cloud provider&#8221; with the companies &#8220;co-develop[ing] AI computing systems.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Anthropic wasn&#8217;t founded with a profit-driven mission, curiously. Dario Amodei, the former VP of research at OpenAI, launched the company in 2021 as a public benefit corporation, taking with him a number of OpenAI employees including OpenAI&#8217;s former public policy lead Jack Clark. Amodei split from OpenAI after a disagreement over the company\u2019s direction, namely the startup&#8217;s increasingly commercial focus.<\/p>\n<p>But AI systems are expensive to develop and maintain. Ballooning costs led Anthropic to pursue outside backing, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/04\/29\/anthropics-quest-for-better-more-explainable-ai-attracts-580m\/\">including<\/a> a $580 million tranche from a group of investors including disgraced FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried, Caroline Ellison, Jim McClave, Nishad Singh, Jaan Tallinn and the Center for Emerging Risk Research.<\/p>\n<p>Whether startup partnerships &#8212; and Big Tech investments &#8212; denote a shift in Anthropic&#8217;s priorities isn&#8217;t yet clear. But what <em>is<\/em> clear is that the company believes its technology is differentiated to compete with rivals like OpenAI, Cohere and AI21 Labs, all of which offer paid access to their text-generating AI via APIs.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Anthropic, a buzzy AI startup co-founded by ex-OpenAI employees, has begun offering partners access to its AI text-generating models.

James then co-founded three other successful companies \u2013 Wonderhill (online video games, merged with Kabam in 2010 which then sold for $800M), IronPearl (growth analytics SaaS, acquired by PayPal in 2013), and Jiff (enterprise healthcare software, raised $68M from Venrock, GE, J&amp;J, merged with Castlight in 2017 \u2014 NASDAQ: CSLT). In 2015, James co-founded NFX, a $475M early-stage venture capital firm focused on network effect businesses. He is a pioneer of user-generated models, viral marketing, A\/B testing, crowdsourcing, and myriad other growth techniques that have since been adopted by nearly all technology companies, including LinkedIn and Facebook.
