The paid subscription includes other features as well, including improved impersonation protection and direct access to customer support, plus more visibility through upranked posts. It&#8217;s initially <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/02\/24\/meta-verified-is-rolling-out-to-users-in-australia-and-new-zeland\/\">rolling out to Australia and New Zealand<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Twitter&#8217;s initial attempt at paid verification proved problematic, as users bought the badge then changed their name and profile picture to troll other high-profile accounts (including Musk) and businesses. Twitter had to pause the service and readjust.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Seemingly learning from Twitter&#8217;s mistakes, Meta&#8217;s paid badge has a few more rules in place.<\/p>\n<p>For starters, users must verify their identity with a government-issued ID card, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/02\/22\/meta-verified-wont-let-you-change-name-username-or-profile-photo-for-now\/\">and then won\u2019t be able to change<\/a> their profile name, username, date of birth or photo after paying for verification. If they later want to make a change, they&#8217;ll need to unsubscribe and then get reverified. This dramatically cuts down on bad actors, though could be a bit of a pain for creators who like to refresh their photos from time to time. However, it may not always be this way &#8212; Meta said it&#8217;s working on a feature that will eventually allow users to change these settings through a new verification process that won&#8217;t require them to cancel and resubscribe&#8230; it&#8217;s just not ready yet.<\/p>\n<p>Also of note: Meta Verified won&#8217;t verify users across Facebook and Instagram &#8212; users will have to buy separate plans for the two apps, and Facebook&#8217;s subscription, for now, is only sold on the web. That means customers will be shelling out $27 per month at the current prices for access to this badge and other perks across Meta&#8217;s apps. (The subscription is $11.99 per month on the web and $14.99 per month on iOS or Android.)<\/p>\n<p>The trend toward paid verification is a potentially fraught move for social networks like Meta and Twitter, as they&#8217;re now responsible for services that users believe should be free &#8212; things like safety, security and customer service. Being able to identify an account as authentic is seen as a feature the networks should provide to ensure that their users can trust who they&#8217;re interacting with. And being able to get help with problems like impersonation or other customer support issues is also considered something that should be a part of the social network&#8217;s core service. By stratifying these features into pay-to-play tiers, the networks are setting up a system where people with money have a better class of service than those with less to spend. But security and trust shouldn&#8217;t be sold as if they&#8217;re upgraded seats on an airplane, they should be baked into the core offering.<\/p>\n<h3>Instagram co-founders launch their new app&#8230; and it&#8217;s for news<\/h3>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2477785\" style=\"width: 1210px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2477785\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-2477785 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Product_Shot.jpeg\" alt=\"Artifact displayed on smartphone laid on colored tiles\/blocks\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Product_Shot.jpeg 1200w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Product_Shot.jpeg?resize=150,100 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Product_Shot.jpeg?resize=300,200 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Product_Shot.jpeg?resize=768,512 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Product_Shot.jpeg?resize=680,453 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Product_Shot.jpeg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2477785\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Artifact<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\"><a href=\"https:\/\/artifact.news\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Artifact<\/a>, the\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/01\/31\/instagrams-co-founders-introduce-a-new-social-app-for-news-reading\/\">personalized news reader built by Instagram\u2019s co-founders<\/a>, is now open to the public, no sign-up required.

But it will also group your reading more narrowly by specific topics. In other words, instead of just \u201ctech\u201d or \u201cAI,\u201d you might find you\u2019ve read a lot about the topic \u201cChatGPT,\u201d specifically.<\/p>\n<p>The launch of a brand-new app from Instagram\u2019s founders, and particularly one focused on news, was a surprise \u2014 especially given the difficulties of\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2014\/3\/6\/5475778\/the-smarter-news-apps-are-the-dumber-they-get\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">launching a news reader here in the U.S.<\/a>, where it would have to compete with offerings from the tech giants, like\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/06\/21\/google-news-launches-a-new-desktop-design-with-topic-customization\/\">Google News<\/a>, Apple News and, of course \u2014 from the founders\u2019 earlier employer \u2014 Meta\u2019s own News Feed.

Before the waitlist was lifted, the app had around 47,000 installs, according to data.ai. As of late this past week, it had climbed to No. 4 in the U.S. App Store&#8217;s News category, but hadn&#8217;t broken into the Top Free Charts. [Update: the most recent data now shows 66K installs and the app is ranking No. 5 in the News category in the U.S., No. 5 in the UK, and higher in some EMEA markets including Malta, Spain, Israel, and Hungary.)<\/p>\n<h3>Spotify launches an AI DJ<\/h3>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2489005\" style=\"width: 324px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2489005\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"vertical size-large wp-image-2489005\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/IMG_4997.png?w=314\" alt=\"\" width=\"314\" height=\"680\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/IMG_4997.png 1290w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/IMG_4997.png?resize=69,150 69w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/IMG_4997.png?resize=138,300 138w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/IMG_4997.png?resize=768,1665 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/IMG_4997.png?resize=314,680 314w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/IMG_4997.png?resize=709,1536 709w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/IMG_4997.png?resize=945,2048 945w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/IMG_4997.png?resize=554,1200 554w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/IMG_4997.png?resize=23,50 23w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 314px) 100vw, 314px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2489005\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Spotify screenshot<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>Ah, what a time to be alive! Music streaming service Spotify this week launched an AI DJ to personalize the music listening experience for its users. Similar to a radio DJ, Spotify\u2019s DJ feature will deliver a curated selection of music alongside, in its case, AI-powered spoken commentary about the tracks and artists you like, using what Spotify says is a \u201cstunningly realistic voice.\u201d (The voice is based on Spotify\u2019s Head of Cultural Partnerships Xavier \u201cX\u201d Jernigan, who had hosted Spotify\u2019s morning show podcast, \u201cThe Get Up.\u201d)<\/p>\n<p>To access the DJ, you\u2019ll head to the Music Feed on the Home page of Spotify\u2019s iOS or Android app, then tap Play on the DJ card to begin. The DJ will then begin to play a lineup of music and short commentary. As listeners engage with the DJ feature, they\u2019ll be presented with a personalized stream of songs that will include both newer tracks and old favorites, and a variety of genres. But it&#8217;s not a long-running playlist. After you move through one style of music or selection (like your summer throwbacks), you&#8217;re then presented with another (like your favorite hip-hop tracks). This experience feels more like Spotify tied its personalized playlists together, then interspersed them with commentary.<\/p>\n<p>The interesting thing here is that Spotify said it&#8217;s leveraging Generative AI through the use of OpenAI technology to create the commentary, which is meant to scale its in-house music experts&#8217; insights about music, artists and genres. Meanwhile, its AI voice comes from its <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/06\/13\/spotify-is-acquiring-sonantic-the-ai-voice-platform-used-to-simulate-val-kilmers-voice-in-top-gun-maverick\/\">2022 Sonantic acquisition.<\/a> Spotify has led the market for years with its personalization tech for crafting playlists, but now its rivals have their own versions of this type of experience. By adding an AI DJ, Spotify hopes to attract and retain users who want a more lean-back experience while introducing a new feature that can&#8217;t be quickly copied by the competition.<\/p>\n<h1>Platforms<\/h1>\n<h3>Apple<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Apple is offering <a href=\"https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/news\/?id=tfb0r2ql\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">new sessions with App Store experts<\/a> February 28 through April 13<\/strong> that will focus on measuring with App Analytics and growing a subscription business using App Store features.<\/li>\n<li><strong>The <a href=\"https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/apple-store\/id375380948\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Apple Store app added the ability to share a saved list<\/a> with friends and family<\/strong> and more ways to access the saved lists from within the app. It&#8217;s also now offering more info about your local stores and their surroundings.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Google<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Google has begun to <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/02\/23\/google-third-party-billing-india\/\">support third-party payments in the Play Store in India<\/a><\/strong> to comply with local regulations.

Then I jump into three themes that stand out from the week, with extra reading for those that want to dig in more. I end with notes to know from around the tech blogosphere, TC events and, if you look closely enough, personal anecdotes that often have to do with coffee and food. Ok, now onto the aforementioned essay!\u00a0<\/em><\/p>\n<p>It all started with a sound. More specifically, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/Archives\/edgar\/data\/1966096\/000196609623000001\/xslFormDX01\/primary_doc.xml\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">an SEC filing from Sound Ventures<\/a>, actor and entrepreneur Ashton Kutcher\u2019s venture firm, confirmed plans to raise an artificial intelligence-focused venture firm. Bloomberg estimates that the new investment vehicle <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2023-02-10\/ashton-kutcher-s-sound-ventures-considers-200-million-ai-fund\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">could total around $200 million dollars upon close.<\/a><\/p>\n<p>While Kutcher\u2019s firm has been around for a long time and has lived through enough hype cycles to not be easily swayed one way or another, the filing made me curious. Are we going to see more celebrity-led venture firms jump onto the AI bandwagon? Especially since crypto, the hype train\u2019s ol\u2019 favorite sector, has sputtered and struggled in recent months?<\/p>\n<p>If you ask me, I\u2019d bet that we won\u2019t see the same rush of celebrities looking to promote AI products on their Instagram stories the way they promoted [insert coin offering here]. It\u2019s complicated, and I may be entirely wrong.

Luckily, there\u2019s a startup angle to tell us more. TC\u2019s Christine Hall wrote about <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/02\/17\/higher-egg-prices-yield-demand-for-alternatives\/\">how higher egg prices have burst open a bigger demand for alternatives.<\/a> If you\u2019re like me and just know about Just Egg, this story is illuminating for so many reasons.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Here\u2019s why it&#8217;s important, Hall tells me: \u201c<\/strong>There wasn&#8217;t a definitive yes or no about pushing the gas pedal on [alternative egg startups] getting more product out there. I was hoping someone would say, yes, startups should go for it, or no, this is just a passing thing and they should wait.

At the time of announcement, the deal was largely seen as Adobe taking out one of its biggest rivals in the design world. Immediately, folks including TC\u2019s Ingrid Lunden <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/09\/15\/adobe-is-buying-figma-for-20b-taking-out-one-of-its-biggest-rivals-in-digital-design\/\">rang some alarm bells<\/a> around Adobe\u2019s future dominance, as both a platform and tooling leader in the space.<\/p>\n<p>Also, Ehab Bandar, founder at design consultancy Bigtable.co, told<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/09\/26\/designers-underwhelmed-by-adobe-figma-deal\/\"> TechCrunch back in September<\/a> that \u201cdesigners, and especially cross-functional teams, hate to switch software. Any new tool would need to excel at so many things that Figma is currently doing that it\u2019s hard to imagine any new competitors coming out of the woodwork.\u201d Others saw a potential liquidity event as an opportunity to usher in a new generation of creative, and perhaps entrepreneurial, designers.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/01\/10\/a-timeline-for-startup-ma-processes-key-steps-and-factors-to-consider\/\">A timeline for startup M&amp;A processes: Key steps and factors to consider<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/02\/22\/fintech-klarna-ceo-on-u-s-growth-momentum\/\">Klarna wins over the US<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/01\/11\/google-germany-data-processing-fco-statement-of-objections\/\">Google users not given sufficient choice over its data processing, says German antitrust watchdog<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2429223\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2429223\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2429223\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/TechCrunch-Disrupt-Haje-Kamps-780.jpg\" alt=\"Dylan Field, CEO at Figma on the TechCrunch Disrupt stage in San Francisco on October 20, 2022.

pivoting to a business that aims to sell its solar vehicle technology to other companies.<\/p>\n<p>The German-based company, which went <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/11\/18\/sono-motors-has-gone-public-aims-to-get-sion-solar-electric-vehicle-to-market-by-2023\/\">public in November 2022<\/a>, announced Friday it is laying off 300 employees as a result of the change in business model. COO Thomas Hausch is also leaving his position.<\/p>\n<p>The shift appears to be driven by a one-two punch of a high-cost EV program coupled with quickly depleting capital. Sono Motors has been plagued by financial issues for years, at one point nearly shutting down altogether until it appealed to and received support from individuals through a crowdfunding campaign.<\/p>\n<p>The Sion EV program, while the original centerpiece of the company, has been a consistent drag on its budget.\u00a0The company said an estimated 90% of its funding needs for 2023 were dedicated to the <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/10\/14\/inside-sono-motors-family-friendly-25000-solar-ev\/\">Sion EV<\/a>, a $25,000 five-seater hatchback that was supposed to go into production later this year.<\/p>\n<p>Sono Motors will now turn its attention to selling a technology that it <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/07\/26\/sono-motors-reveals-final-design-of-its-solar-charging-sion-ev\/\">developed for its Sion EV<\/a>: solar embedded into the vehicle. The company&#8217;s business will retrofit and integrate its solar technology, which includes power electronics and software, onto commercial vehicles such as buses as well as cars produced by OEMs.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;This pivot marks a significant step in Sono Motors&#8217; business development,&#8221; Sono Motors CEO and co-founder Laurin Hahn said in a statement. &#8220;Even though we had to terminate our original passion project, the Sion program, shifting our entire focus to business-to-business solar solutions provides us with an opportunity to continue to create innovative products in the solar space. It was a difficult decision and despite more than 45,000 reservations and pre-orders for the Sion, we were compelled to react to the ongoing financial market instability and streamline our business.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Sono said it has 23 business-to-business customers today that are piloting its integrated solar technology on a range of vehicles, including third-party OEM cars, buses, refrigerated vehicles and recreational vehicles. Sono said it&#8217;s working with Mitsubishi Europe, CHEREAU and Volkswagen subsidiaries Scania and MAN Truck &amp; Bus.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>The German-based company got its start in 2016 when co-founders Jona Christians, Laurin Hahn and Navina Pernsteiner \u2014 seeking a way to reduce society&#8217;s dependence on fossil fuels \u2014 kicked off an ambitious plan to build an electric passenger vehicle that was partially powered by the sun. (Pernsteiner left the company in 2020.) From afar, prototypes of the Sion vehicle looked like a compact car with black paint. Upon closer inspection, the entire exterior of the vehicle was actually comprised of hundreds of solar cells that had been integrated into polymer instead of glass.<\/p>\n<p>In January 2021, the company announced it planned to <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/01\/12\/sono-motors-plans-to-license-the-tech-that-powers-its-solar-electric-car\/\">license its solar body panel technology<\/a> to other companies. These solar cells convert sunlight into energy, which is stored in the vehicle\u2019s battery. At the time, Hahn said the technology will make vehicles less dependent on charging infrastructure. It can also support auxiliary power applications such as the electricity used to power a refrigerated truck.<\/p>\n<p>A product, dubbed the &#8220;Solar Bus Kit&#8221; is planned for the second quarter of 2023.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Sono Motors is ending its long-awaited electric car program and instead pivoting to a business that aims to sell its solar vehicle technology to other companies.

RAM runs 4GB to 32GB and storage is available from 32 to 256GB (you can get that up to 2TB with add ons).<\/p>\n<p>There isn\u2019t any the same built-in nostalgia present that you\u2019ll find in Planet\u2019s mobile devices.

of drone tech, InsureTech Flock raises $38M Series B to nudge commercial drivers towards safety"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">It\u2019s only human nature. If you tell a driver their insurance premium will go down if they drive more safely, then &#8211; it turns out &#8211; they will probably drive more safely. Scale that up to entire commercial fleets and the costs saving can become extremely significant. However, the trick is to do the tracking in the first place. <\/p>\n<p>So it\u2019s fascinating to think that research into <em>how to insure drones<\/em> led to the creation of UK startup <a href=\"https:\/\/flockcover.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Flock<\/a>, which uses real-time data to ensure car fleets.<\/p>\n<p>Ed Leon Klinger and Antton Pena were both working on two academic research papers, the former at Cambridge University, the latter at Imperial College London, when they had an idoea. \u201cThe first product we launched was in the drone industry. It was a pay-as-you-fly drone insurance product that used drone data. And, actually, that was our stepping stone into commercial motor. We built technology. And we built a capability to use real time data by being born in the drone industry,\u201d Klinger tells me. <\/p>\n<p>Stumbling on the idea of insuring drones only when they were flying, led Klinger and Pena realised that cars could be insured the same way, as well as adding in the idea of gamifying drivers into driving more safely. <\/p>\n<p>The result was Flock <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/05\/29\/flock-raises-2-25m-for-its-on-demand-drone-insurance\/\">in 2018<\/a>, which went on to <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/07\/29\/connected-car-insurance-startup-flock-raises-17m-series-a-led-by-chamath-palihapitiya\/\">raise<\/a> $17 million in a Series A in 2021.<\/p>\n<p>And, while Uk based <a href=\"https:\/\/www.zego.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Zego<\/a> has raised $281.7M to date to off something similar (as regards fleet tracking for insurance), Flock now appears to be in Zego&#8217;s  rear view mirror. Indeed, insurance behemoths such as AIG and Allianz are likely to be as much compeitors in this space today.<\/p>\n<p>Flock has now added to its war chest with a $38 million Series B funding, led by\u00a0Octopus\u00a0Ventures (via Octopus partner Malcolm Ferguson) , with <a href=\"https:\/\/commerzventures.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">CommerzVentures<\/a>. Also participating were existing investors including Social Capital (led by Chamath Palihapitia), Dig Ventures (the family office of MuleSoft Founder Ross Mason), Anthemis, and Foresight Ventures. Flock\u2019s Series A was led by Palihapitia in 2021.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Flock now lays claim to over 600 commercial fleet customers, including Jaguar Land Rover, Europe\u2019s electric car subscription company Onto, and a third of the UK&#8217;s independent Amazon fleets, it says. <\/p>\n<p>Flock says its use of telematics allows customers to understand risk and identify high-risk drivers and routes. This helps them reduce crash frequency by as much as 10%. Thus safer driving is then rewarded with lower insurance premiums.<\/p>\n<p>Klinger, Flock&#8217;s CEO told me on a call: \u201cWe&#8217;ve grown revenues about 30 times since the Series A. We&#8217;ve only recently launched our motor fleet product and we&#8217;ve landed about 600 commercial customers. Those are commercial fleets. About one third of the UK is Amazon fleets and we now ensure about one third of those fleets. We&#8217;ve also partnered with about 100 commercial insurance brokers in the UK and I believe that is one of the core reasons that we were able to raise a Series B.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The funding round comes at a time when Series B and growth stage funding rounds are somewhere rarer, which makes Flock\u2019s achievement more notable in terms of the fundamentals of the business and team.<\/p>\n<p>The round will be used to to expand into new segments of the commercial motor industry as well as new geographies.<\/p>\n<p>Malcolm Ferguson, Partner,\u00a0Octopus\u00a0Ventures, said in \u201ca statement: \u201cFlock has a vision that can make the world safer not just for today\u2019s vehicles but for the connected and autonomous vehicles of tomorrow.&#8221;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It\u2019s only human nature.

In January, the Oppo-owned mobile brand unveiled its new flagship, the OnePlus 11. Earlier this month, the 11R arrived, focused on the growing Indian smartphone market. These days, the company also offers last year\u2019s 10T and 10 Pro, three budget Nord devices, five earbuds and a tablet. A new mechanical keyboard is on the way, along with some rumored foldables.<\/p>\n<p>As change of pace, the company showcased a product this week at MWC that will never see the light of day \u2013 or at least not in its current form. As the name implies, the OnePlus 11 Concept is effectively a remix of the company\u2019s current flagship. The key differentiators, however, point to a company hoping to get more serious about mobile gaming. The gaming phone market has been something of a mixed bag, putting it mildly, and there\u2019s no clear indication that it will ever release such a device.<\/p>\n<p>A more likely approach involves generational advances that make more serious gaming more plausible on the small screen. \u201cWe will make a lot of efforts in research and design of the technology,\u201d OnePlus President and COO Kinder Liu told TechCrunch through a translator. \u201cBut as for the commercial availability of these technologies, we will further analyze the market and the technology\u2019s maturity.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2491174\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2491174\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2491174\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/OnePlus-11-Concept-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/OnePlus-11-Concept-1.jpg 8000w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/OnePlus-11-Concept-1.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/OnePlus-11-Concept-1.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/OnePlus-11-Concept-1.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/OnePlus-11-Concept-1.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/OnePlus-11-Concept-1.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/OnePlus-11-Concept-1.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/OnePlus-11-Concept-1.jpg?resize=1200,675 1200w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/OnePlus-11-Concept-1.jpg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2491174\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> OnePlus<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>Liu explains that gauging consumer interest is one \u201cmultiple reasons\u201d OnePlus went the automaker route with the unveiling of a liquid cooled handset. \u201cAlso, we want to encourage continuous innovation inside our company,\u201d he adds.<\/p>\n<p>OnePlus calls the new technology, \u201cActive CryoFlux.\u201d A 0.2 square centimeter piezoelectric ceramic micropump moves the coolant up and down a pipeline near the rear of the device and around the massive camera array.

Community was a major factor in OnePlus\u2019 growth from the outset, but many consumers have feared that being rolled into Chinese mobile giant Oppo has caused it to drift from that initial focus. A prime example are the original plans to merge OnePlus\u2019 OxygenOS with Oppo\u2019s Color OS. The company abandoned the move a year ago, following user backlash.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI think one thing can be improved,\u201d says Liu, \u201cand that\u2019s we need to have better communication with the outside world.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Is gaming the next frontier for device makers now that the initial 5G adoption bump has long since died out?

carriers team up with AWS, Microsoft to launch Open Gateway, a set of Twilio-like APIs to tap network services"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">APIs are the building blocks of how the world of technology works: used to integrate applications with each other, API calls make up the <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.cloudflare.com\/landscape-of-api-traffic\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">majority of global internet traffic<\/a> these days. Now, telecoms carriers, often cut out of the march of tech but now looking for more ways to monetize next-generation networks like 5G, want to get in on he act.<\/p>\n<p>Today the GSMA &#8212; the association representing the world&#8217;s major mobile operators &#8212; announced a new initiative with 21 carriers called Open Gateway, a framework to provide universal, open-source-based APIs into carrier networks for developers to access and use a variety of mobile network services like location or identity verificaiton and carrier billing, which previously would have been more complicated or more expensive (if not impossible) to integrate and use. The plan is to be able to kick off more development using APIs in applications like immersive mixed-reality experiences and web3 applications that will in turn give more 5G business to the mobile carriers.<\/p>\n<p>Timed with the kick-off of GSMA&#8217;s big industry show, MWC in Barcelona, Amazon&#8217;s AWS and Microsoft&#8217;s Azure were named as the first two big cloud providers working with carriers to provide access to APIs to developers.<\/p>\n<p>Initial carriers that have signed up to Open Gateway are America Movil, AT&amp;T, Axiata, Bharti Airtel, China Mobile, Deutsche Telekom, e&amp; Group, KDDI, KT, Liberty Global, MTN, Orange, Singtel, Swisscom, STC, Telef\u00f3nica, Telenor, Telstra, TIM, Verizon and Vodafone. These carriers have signed a memorandum of understanding, and the plan is to build and work on these APIs by way of&nbsp;CAMARA, an open source project co-developed by the Linux Foundation and the GSMA for this purpose: to help developers access &#8220;enhanced&#8221; network capabilities.<\/p>\n<p>The carriers have invested billions in new networking technology, but they don&#8217;t really have a lot of usage on those networks. This move is being driven in part by them trying to kick-start activity on them.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cGSMA Open Gateway will enable single points of access to ultra-broadband networks and provide a catalyst for immersive technologies and Web3 \u2013 giving them the ability to fulfill their potential and reach critical mass,&#8221; said Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda \u00c1lvarez-Pallete L\u00f3pez, the chairman of the GSMA as well as the CEO and chairman of Telef\u00f3nica. &#8220;Telcos have come a long way in developing a global platform to connect everyone and everything. And now, by federating open network APIs and applying the roaming concept of interoperability, mobile operators and cloud services will be truly integrated to enable a new world of opportunity. Collaboration amongst telecom operators and cloud providers is crucial in this new digital ecosystem.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>No details have been given about which services we might see rolled out first. Open Gateway is launching initially with API specifications for eight services: SIM swap (eSIMs to change carriers more easily; &#8220;quality on demand&#8221;; device status (to let users know if they are connected to a home or roaming network); number verify; edge site selection and routing; number verification (SMS 2FA); carrier billing or check out; and device location (when a service needs a location verfiied). There will be more APIs added this year, it saiid. Perhaps some of the names might also get tweaked. SIM swap, for example, already has a more <a href=\"https:\/\/www.yubico.com\/resources\/glossary\/sim-swap\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">nefarious connotation<\/a>. The MWC event will feature a number of demos showing off how the APIs could be used.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>The news is an interesting development given the history of mobile carriers and the role they&#8217;ve played particularly since the boom in smartphone usage.<\/p>\n<p>Mobile carriers have long had a fear of becoming a &#8220;bit pipe&#8221; &#8212; a commodity with services sold at increasingly competitive (aka low margin) prices. That was a fate that seemed inevitable when smartphones and apps came along. New content was delivered over the top of mobile networks (not by the networks themselves). App stores controlled by phone makers (not the carriers) distributed that content, and charged for it. And companies like Apple and Google increasingly call the shots with how even network services themselves were getting provisioned.<\/p>\n<p>Carriers have thought they could stave off bit-pipe relegation, though, by way of their advantages: they have the main relationship with users when it comes to getting basic services like voice and data, and their mobile networks have built into them a lot of different functionality on top of that basic provisioning that they&#8217;ve thought would give them openings to build their own app stores and more.<\/p>\n<p>Various <a href=\"https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/verizonwireless-idUSN2418017820100324\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">efforts<\/a> however have had very <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2015\/12\/08\/mozilla-will-stop-developing-and-selling-firefox-os-smartphones\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">mixed success<\/a>. Now, the shift to opening up those mobile networks by creating APIs for third parties to use those tools more easily can either be in two ways: as revolutionary &#8212; telcos have always been very guarded about their networks, and now they are realizing that there is a value to thinking in a more modern way about this to bring more evolution and progress into the industry, giving developers a less fragmented, more scalable option by building APIs that work everywhere, in line with how people can roam easily between networks when travelling. Or, it could be read as a kind of defeat: if they can&#8217;t beat tech giants, join them.<\/p>\n<p>Amazon and Microsoft have been building out a longer-term relationship with carriers, in part to create more trust with them after years of being seen as a threat. (Both have in the past posed their own competitive profiles to telcos, although Microsoft has a longer and more complicated history here, banked around its disastrous acquisition of Nokia.) Last week, as a precursor to today&#8217;s news, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/02\/21\/amazons-aws-cozies-up-to-carriers-launches-2-services-to-build-and-operate-networks-in-the-cloud\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">AWS announced a raft of new products<\/a> to work with carriers to build and run mobile networks; and last night <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/02\/26\/microsoft-azure-expands-its-telco-solutions\/?tpcc=tcplustwitter\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Microsoft released<\/a> new services of its own for telcos.<\/p>\n<p>The tech partners are, predictably for a GSMA event, singing the praises and potential of the deal.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;At Microsoft, we are focused on extending a distributed computing fabric from the cloud to the edge, together with our operator partners,&#8221; said Satya Nadella, chairman and CEO, Microsoft, in a statement. &#8220;We look forward to bringing the GSMA Open Gateway initiative to Microsoft Azure, to empower developers and help operators monetise the value of their 5G investments.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Ishwar Parulkar, chief technologist for AWS&#8217;s telco business, likened the step being taken here as the next one in the progress started not by telcos but by tech companies, specifically Twilio with its groundbreaking APIs years ago to access SMS capabilities among developers.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">&#8220;Its about network as a service,&#8221; he said in an interview. AWS has been working on 5G and cloud services for it back in 2019, and &#8220;One of the thoughts [even then] was that we could change the experience if we could add APIs into it.&#8221; It&#8217;s taken nearly four years, but that seems to be here.<\/p>\n<p>There are, as with payments, location services and more these days, always going to be software solutions that will work around whatever the carriers do, so it&#8217;s a matter of who can do it first and most easily for developers and ultimately users to adopt.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;They know there is a lot of work to do and not a lot of guaranteed success but they have got to try,&#8221; Simon Buckingham, founder of 5G consultants Nonvoice, said in an interview. &#8220;With something like edge compute, if you can start charging for quality as a service, for telcos that have spent millions on infrastructure, if you can charge a premium for that, it can be a game changer.

Indian fintech platform broadens its offerings to boost engagement and monetization on the platform.<\/p>\n<p>Cred flash, the Bengaluru-headquartered startup\u2019s foray into buy now and pay later category, will allow customers to make seamless payment on the app and across over 500 partner merchants including Swiggy, Zepto and Urban Company and clear the bill at no charge in 30 days.<\/p>\n<p>The customized credit extended to customers will allow them to make bill payments and recharges and other expenses with a single swipe and without having to wait for an OTP authentication code, said the startup, which is <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/06\/09\/india-cred-valued-at-6-5-billion-in-new-funding\/\">valued at over $6 billion<\/a>. The service, powered by RBI-registered NBFC Parfait Finance and Investments Pvt Limited, will initially roll out to a select group of customers, the startup said.<\/p>\n<p>The BNPL product is the latest in a series of new offerings from CRED in recent years as it moves to make its eponymous fintech app a bigger part of its customers\u2019 lives.<\/p>\n<p>The startup, which also offers its customers the ability to <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/08\/19\/indian-fintech-cred-launches-peer-to-peer-lending-feature-mint\/\">lend to one another on the platform<\/a> at \u201cinflation beating\u201d rates, last year launched Scan and Pay, its fast UPI QR payments that allows customers to earn rewards for each transaction they made to merchants and also protect their identity by using aliases.<\/p>\n<p>CRED, which has amassed 16 million users, started its life as a utility tool for tracking and paying credit card bills. It serves some of India\u2019s most trustworthy customers as the app only onboards those who have at least a 750 credit score. This threshold has made CRED a more feasible testbed for additional financial services, even if those offerings have existed on other platforms for years.<\/p>\n<p>A handful of startups in India offer buy now and pay later services, but many of the prominent names in the category including Zip-backed ZestMoney are struggling financially as they mostly cater to an audience base with thin credit bureau history.<\/p>\n<p>CRED said it is also rolling out a tap to pay feature that will allow users to make payments through their credit cards with their phones with a tap on the terminal machine. The feature, first rolling out to NFC-enabled Android smartphones, will require members to unlock their phone before they tap on the merchant\u2019s PoS machine.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cTap to Pay addresses CRED members\u2019 need for a fast, simple, and safe offline payment experience.

Azure expands its telco solutions"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">New smartphones may get most of the headlines at MWC, but at its core, the annual trade show is still a telco event. It&#8217;s maybe no surprise then that the large cloud providers, who are all vying for the lucrative telco market, also made a few announcements ahead of the event. AWS jumped ahead of its competitors by announcing its <a href=\"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/entertainment\/aws-announces-aws-telco-network-170000334.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">news<\/a> a week early and today, it&#8217;s Microsoft&#8217;s turn. The new features the company today announced for telco&#8217;s using its Azure cloud services focus on four areas: network transformation, automation and AI, network-aware applications and what Microsoft calls &#8220;ubiquitous computing from cloud to edge.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The future hyperscale cloud is going to look a lot different than the cloud we have today,&#8221; Jason Zander, Microsoft&#8217;s EVP for Strategic Missions and Tech, told me. &#8220;Our expectation is that it&#8217;s going to expand; it will be a highly distributed fabric; it&#8217;s going to span from 5G to space. That future &#8212; this intelligent cloud, this intelligent edge &#8212; has to be powered by a modern network infrastructure. And it&#8217;s going to enable a new type of application and we need a new connectivity paradigm for that. We call that modern connected applications. Basically, we&#8217;re on track to give you applications that can be connected anywhere, anytime on the entire planet. That&#8217;s where we&#8217;re headed and we want to make sure that we are part of that future. And it&#8217;s a natural extension of the cloud and also an opportunity for us to partner with the telecommunications industry.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>As he noted, Microsoft believes that a modern network infrastructure will drive a lower total cost of ownership for its telco partners while also helping them modernize and monetize their existing infrastructure. To do so, Microsoft is launching Azure Operator Nexus today, its next-gen hybrid cloud platform for communication service providers. It allows these companies to run their carrier-grade workloads both on-premises and on Azure.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;AT&amp;T made the decision to adopt Azure Operator Nexus platform over time with expectation to lower total cost of ownership, leverage the power of AI to simplify operations, improve time to market and focus on our core competency of building the world\u2019s best 5G service,&#8221; said Igal Elbaz, Senior Vice President, Network CTO, AT&amp;T.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">It&#8217;s not just about software, though. Zander explained that when Microsoft first approached this space, the company thought that it could simply apply the same technology it had built for Azure and apply it to the telco space. But that didn&#8217;t work. &#8220;It&#8217;s a combination of hardware, hardware acceleration, and the software that goes with it,&#8221; Zander explained. &#8220;This is important, because Microsoft has a set of edge cloud hardware &#8212; but it&#8217;s not built for it. When you see vendors talking about using the same thing to run an IT workload as they are planning on running a telco network, it doesn&#8217;t work and it&#8217;s exactly why we&#8217;ve made this multi-year investment.&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<p>As part of today&#8217;s announcements, Microsoft is also launching <a href=\"https:\/\/azure.microsoft.com\/en-us\/products\/communications-gateway\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Azure Communications Gateway<\/a>, its service for connecting fixed and mobile networks to Teams, into general availability and it&#8217;s launching Azure Operator Voicemail, a service that allows operators to migrate their voicemail (remember voicemail?) services to Azure as a fully managed service.<\/p>\n<p>On the AI front, Microsoft is launching two new &#8220;AIOps&#8221; services &#8212; Azure Operator Insights and Azure Operator Service Manager. Operator Insights uses machine learning to help operators analyze the massive amounts of data they gather from their network operations and troubleshoot potential issues, while Service Manager helps operators generate insights about their network configurations.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>With this announcement, Microsoft is also putting an emphasis on building network-aware applications. For the most part, this is about managing quality of service for specific applications. That may be 5G data from autonomous cars or connecting next-gen flying vehicles like the Volocopter, a company Microsoft has <a href=\"https:\/\/www.volocopter.com\/newsroom\/volocopter-collaborates-with-microsoft-on-voloiq-aerospace-cloud-project\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">partnered with for a while<\/a>, to the cloud. As Zander noted, this requires a back and forth between the carriers and developers &#8212; and since no developer is going to create a service that only works on one network, there needs to be some interoperability here. With the Linux Foundation&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linuxfoundation.org\/press\/press-release\/linux-foundation-announces-new-project-camara-the-telco-global-api-alliance-with-global-industry-ecosystem\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Project Camara<\/a>, Microsoft, Google Cloud, IBM, Ericsson, Intel and others have been working with carriers like AT&amp;T, Deutsche Telecom, Orange, T-Mobile US, Telefonica, TELUS and Vodafone to create an open API standard for some of this work. &#8220;They get it. They know they want to differentiate &#8212; but they also know that if there&#8217;s fragment in the app ecosystem, it&#8217;ll just stall one way or the other,&#8221; said Zander.<\/p>\n<p>Also new today is the general availability of the Azure Private 5G Core and Microsoft&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/azure.microsoft.com\/en-us\/solutions\/private-multi-access-edge-compute-mec\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">multi-access edge compute<\/a> (MEC) service.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/tag\/mwc-2023\/\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/mwc-2023-banner.jpg\" alt=\"Read more about MWC 2023 on TechCrunch\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>New smartphones may get most of the headlines at MWC, but at its core, the annual trade show is still a telco event.

Many employees worried that this was the first sign of layoffs to come, and while correlation does not equal causation, an entire company being cut off from their main mode of communication as layoffs started dropping like bombs caused confusion and panic all around.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>&#8220;Slack is gone so noone know what is going on,&#8221; reads one <a href=\"https:\/\/www.teamblind.com\/post\/This-weekend-Layoff-in-Twitter-6bwhhnn7\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">post on Blind<\/a>, an anonymous platform for verified workers. &#8220;People receive email at 2am on saturday and access cut immediately. This will go down as one of the most extreme layoff in entire corporate history&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The post went on to detail the extent of the layoffs: 50% in human relations, 60% in sales and marketing, 35% in engineering, 40% in finance and 80% in project management. Employees have received one month&#8217;s severance, the poster said. Twitter has not responded to requests for comment, nor has it released a public statement on the layoffs.<\/p>\n<p>The Information&#8217;s report also notes that Twitter kicked off this round of layoffs by letting go of its ad sales staff on February 17.<\/p>\n<p>A senior product manager, Martijn de Kuijper, tweeted that he found out about his own lack of a job after being locked out of his email account.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Waking up to find I&#8217;ve been locked out of my email.

But <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.thirdeyegen.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ThirdEye<\/a> thinks its up for the challenge. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ThirdEye is a spin-off of a project for the Department of Defense. Stealthily, it has been making steady in-roads into the AR smart glasses and the accompanying AI software space. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The ThirdEye glasses may look like safety goggles \u2014 and they are, to some degree \u2014 but they do much more. The company&#8217;s second-gen <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thirdeyegen.com\/x2-smart-glasses\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">X2 MR<\/a> lets people access documents or schematics hands-free while working on a project. Live digital information can be projected onto the user\u2019s field of view; it can also relay live images to a tablet or phone, allowing colleagues to provide guidance or oversee an activity. There\u2019s also a low-resolution thermal sensor built into the glasses. And they\u2019re lightweight.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The company quickly found a customer in the military, which is making use of the tech for classified things. But, ThirdEye CEO Nick Cherukuri told TechCrunch that the glasses could be used for more mundane applications, as well, like helping technicians make repairs in remote settings.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2490220\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2490220\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout size-full wp-image-2490220\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/ThirdEye-2-Large.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"556\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/ThirdEye-2-Large.jpeg 1214w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/ThirdEye-2-Large.jpeg?resize=150,81 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/ThirdEye-2-Large.jpeg?resize=300,163 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/ThirdEye-2-Large.jpeg?resize=768,417 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/ThirdEye-2-Large.jpeg?resize=680,369 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/ThirdEye-2-Large.jpeg?resize=1200,651 1200w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/ThirdEye-2-Large.jpeg?resize=50,27 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2490220\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A combat medic gets instructions via the ThirdEye glasses. <strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> ThirdEye<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And that&#8217;s just the beginning. ThirdEye&#8217;s technology became especially important during the pandemic; the glasses allowed for clearer treatment options and diagnoses without too many people having to come into contact with each other. ThirdEye saw its opportunity and developed HIPAA-compliant telehealth AR software to go with it.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In August 2022, the U.K.\u2019s National Health Service launched a trial where community nurses wore the goggles when making home visits. By transcribing a patient\u2019s visit record directly to their notes (with their consent), the company says its glasses could reduce the amount of time nurses spent focusing on paperwork rather than with their patients. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The glasses could also help to reduce the need for doctors\u2019 appointments or even hospital admissions by allowing health care professionals to share live footage with colleagues, giving patients an opportunity to get second opinions or more detailed diagnoses. The thermal imaging sensor can be used to assess wound healing, too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><div class=\"extra-crunch-offer-container\"><\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>ThirdEye&#8217;s second-gen X2 MR glasses can be used for various sectors, including health care and manufacturing. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":170861,"featured_media":2490219,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"outcome":"","status":"","crunchbase_tag":0,"amp_status":"","relegenceEntities":[],"relegenceSubjects":[],"carmot_uuid":"85d395fa-d9be-33ca-ab41-dfd238c6da2d","apple_news_api_created_at":"","apple_news_api_id":"","apple_news_api_modified_at":"","apple_news_api_revision":"","apple_news_api_share_url":"","apple_news_coverimage":0,"apple_news_coverimage_caption":"","apple_news_is_hidden":false,"apple_news_is_paid":false,"apple_news_is_preview":false,"apple_news_is_sponsored":false,"apple_news_maturity_rating":"","apple_news_metadata":"\"\"","apple_news_pullquote":"","apple_news_pullquote_position":"","apple_news_slug":"","apple_news_sections":"\"\""},"categories":[577030454,20429],"tags":[282669,22422892,576846677,576866651,576849759,576845141],"crunchbase_tag":[],"tc_stories_tax":[],"tc_ec_category":[576796356],"tc_event":[],"tc_regions_tax":[],"apple_news_notices":[],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/ThirdEye-3-Large.jpeg","parsely":{"version":"1.0.0","meta":[],"rendered":""},"shortlink":"https:\/\/tcrn.ch\/3YZpb8a","parselyMeta":{"parsely-title":"Mapping out the future of AR, ThirdEye is taking on Google and Microsoft in real-life scenarios","parsely-link":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/02\/26\/thirdeye-ar-glasses\/","parsely-type":"post","parsely-pub-date":"2023-02-26T17:00:26+00:00","parsely-image-url":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/ThirdEye-3-Large.jpeg?w=680","parsely-author":["Haje Jan Kamps"],"parsely-section":"Biotech &amp; Health","parsely-tags":"@post-id:2490167,startups,augmented reality,augmented reality technology,ec consumer health,ec enterprise health,ec future of work,ec news analysis,premium-content","parsely-metadata":"{\"@type\":\"NewsArticle\",\"mainEntityOfPage\":{\"@type\":\"WebPage\"},\"dateModified\":\"2023-02-23T22:20:14+00:00\",\"description\":\"ThirdEye&#039;s second-gen X2 MR glasses can be used for various sectors, including health care and manufacturing. \",\"speakable\":{\"@type\":\"SpeakableSpecification\",\"cssSelector\":[\".alpha\",\"#speakable-summary\"]},\"publisher\":{\"@type\":\"Organization\",\"name\":\"TechCrunch\",\"logo\":{\"@type\":\"imageObject\",\"url\":\"https:\\\/\\\/techcrunch.com\\\/wp-content\\\/themes\\\/techcrunch-2017\\\/images\\\/logo-json-ld.png\",\"width\":\"600\",\"height\":\"60\"}}}"},"rapidData":{"pt":"","pct":""},"premiumContent":true,"premiumCutoffPercent":0.43,"featured":false,"subtitle":"","editorialContentProvider":"","tc_cb_mapping":[],"associatedEvent":null,"event":null,"authors":[2217712],"hide_featured_image":false,"canonical_url":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/02\/26\/thirdeye-ar-glasses\/","primary_category":{"term_id":577030454,"name":"Biotech &amp; Health","slug":"biotech-health","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":586588,"taxonomy":"category","description":"Biotech &amp; Health includes everything from the latest health tech and medical devices to research in synthetic biology and genetics.

With this device \u2014 which was launched in China in December \u2014 the company is banking on a one-inch main sensor, Leica lenses and 120W fast charging. This is, in essence, a Samsung Galaxy S series competitor.<\/p>\n<p>Cameras have long been a major differentiating factor in today&#8217;s flagships. Xiaomi is using a massive one-inch Sony IMX989 50-megapixel sensor with f\/1.9 aperture to get the best and brightest photos in all lighting conditions. A couple of phone manufacturers including Vivo and Sharp have already included this sensor in a few devices. The camera is capable of video recording in 8K resolution \u2014 4K resolution at 60 fps if recording in Dolby Vision.<\/p>\n<p>There&#8217;s also a 50-megapixel telephoto camera with a &#8220;floating lens&#8221; element, which results in a 3.2x lossless zoom. Plus, the device has another 50-megapixel ultrawide sensor. The 13 Pro has a 32-megapixel front camera with a night mode and dual-framing (0.8x and 1x) modes.<\/p>\n<p>All those cameras and their Leica lenses are placed in a massive square housing on the back. While we&#8217;ve seen plenty of square camera bumps, the size really makes this one stand out.<\/p>\n<p>Apart from the camera system, the Xiaomi 13 Pro&#8217;s spec sheet standard fare for a 2023 Android flagship. A Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 processor, 6.73-inch WQHD+ AMOLED display with 120Hz refresh rate and 1,900 nits of peak brightness, support for Dolby Vision, HDR10+, and HLG HDR standards, 12GB LPDDR5X RAM and USF 4.0 storage.<\/p>\n<p>Xiaomi&#8217;s latest flagship has a 4,820 mAh battery that can be charged in minutes through a proprietary 120W charger. However, these charging bricks are huge and bulky. The device supports also 50W wireless charging with compatible charging pucks along with 10W reverse charging if you quickly want to top up your earbuds.<\/p>\n<p>The 13 Pro will be available in ceramic white and ceramic black colorways with 256GB and 512GB storage variants. It will be available in Europe from March 8, starting\u00a0 at \u20ac1,200 ($1,373). Along with the new flagship, the company also launched the Xiaomi 13, with a starting price of \u20ac999 ($1,056) and the Xiaomi 13 Lite with a starting price of \u20ac499 ($527).<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>At present, Xiaomi is in a peculiar spot, globally.

I\u2019m not going to lie \u2014 upon learning this, my fintech-loving ears perked up.<\/p>\n<p>Sequoia apparently was fairly active overall last year despite the global downturn, with over 100 investments. And fintech represented <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cbinsights.com\/research\/sequoia-capital-fintech-investment-strategy\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><i>nearly a quarter<\/i><\/a> of the firm\u2019s deals.<\/p>\n<p>We saw a similar trend at a16z. According to CB Insights, of the 206 deals that a16z participated in last year, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cbinsights.com\/research\/a16z-andreessen-horowitz-fintech-investment-strategy\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">almost a quarter<\/a> went to fintech companies \u2014 more than any other industry. Sixty percent of these fintech investments closed in the first half of 2022, with the remainder closing in the second half of the year.<\/p>\n<p>Sequoia backed 25 companies in the financial services space last year. Its top three fintech targets, as identified by CB Insights, were capital markets, payments and payroll and benefits \u2014 with each category representing 16% of its investments.<\/p>\n<p>A16z backed 49 companies in the fintech space last year and its top three fintech targets were payments (28%), blockchain (22%) and digital lending (12%).<\/p>\n<p>Three out of Sequoia\u2019s four deals in the capital markets space were follow-on investments, a reflection of the firm\u2019s \u201cfaith in the future of capital markets tech,\u201d noted CB Insights. Deals it participated in included Citadel Securities&#8217; $1.2 billion round; Capitolis\u2019 <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/03\/22\/capitolis-valued-at-1-6b-after-raising-110m-for-new-tech-to-update-capital-markets-trading\/\">$110 million Series D<\/a>; Watershed\u2019s $70 million Series B; and Ledgy\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/09\/21\/ledgy-a-carta-for-european-startups-to-manage-equity-and-cap-tables-raises-22m-from-nea-sequoia-and-more\/\">$22 million Series B<\/a>.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>More than a quarter (28%) of a16z\u2019s fintech investments in 2022 went to the payments category. For example, it participated in SpotOn\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/05\/18\/square-rival-spoton-lands-300m-at-a-3-6b-valuation-after-seeing-100-arr-growth-in-2021\/\">$300 million Series F<\/a>; Jeeves\u2019 <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/03\/22\/fintech-startup-jeeves-raises-180m-quadruples-valuation-to-2-1b\/\">$180 million Series C<\/a>; and Tally Technologies&#8217; $80 million Series C.<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Sequoia\u2019s investments in payments tech companies spanned both consumer and business payments and operate in four distinct markets: buy now, pay later (BNPL), expense management, peer-to-peer (P2P) payments, and online payments acceptance. Two of the four deals are at the seed stage. Specifically, Sequoia participated in Klarna\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/07\/11\/klarna-confirms-800m-raise-as-valuation-drops-85-to-6-7b\/\">$800 million financing<\/a>; Yokoy\u2019s $80 million Series B; Telda\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/10\/12\/egyptian-consumer-money-app-telda-raises-20m-from-gfc-sequoia-capital-and-block\/\">$20 million seed round<\/a>; and Cococart\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/02\/25\/cococart-seed-e-commerce-orders\/\">$4 million seed financing<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>While blockchain and crypto arguably fall under the fintech category, I usually leave analysis of those segments to our crypto team, so I won\u2019t go into a16z\u2019s blockchain investments.

But wasn\u2019t that true for every sector? Sequoia\u2019s and a16z\u2019s continued bets in the space are just one indication that fintech may be down, but definitely not out.<\/p>\n<h2>Weekly News<\/h2>\n<p>I interviewed <strong>Klarna<\/strong> CEO and co-founder Sebastian Siemiatkowski about the Swedish payment giant\u2019s momentum in the U.S. Highlights of the interview, which you can read about in more detail <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/02\/22\/fintech-klarna-ceo-on-u-s-growth-momentum\/\">here<\/a>, include (1) the fact that the U.S. has overtaken Germany as Klarna\u2019s largest market by revenue, (2) the company\u2019s fastest-growing revenue stream is actually marketing, not BNPL and (3) Sebastian really views Klarna and Affirm as being \u201cvery different\u201d companies in terms of loan duration and amount. On the topic of Klarna and Affirm, I also spoke this past week with Tyson Hendricksen, CEO and founder of a new company called Notice that tracks secondary market trade activity in the private markets. He told me that based on secondary market activity, Klarna appears to be currently valued at around $7.5 billion, which is actually higher than the <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/07\/11\/klarna-confirms-800m-raise-as-valuation-drops-85-to-6-7b\/\">$6.7 billion<\/a> it was valued at last July, but also still significantly lower than the $45 billion it was valued at in 2021. By comparison, Affirm is currently <a href=\"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/quote\/AFRM\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">valued at $3.84 billion<\/a>. Below is a chart Hendricksen provided that illustrates trading activity at the two companies. Affirm is public so the chart shows share price as recorded in the public markets. It also shows a composite price for Klarna that takes into \u00a0account secondary market trades and open bids and offers. Says Hendricksen: &#8220;Think of it as an approximation of the current stock price and valuation using multiple private market data sets.&#8221;<\/p>\n<div dir=\"auto\"><\/div>\n<p>To view it more interactively, click <a href=\"https:\/\/ntce.co\/41lv55c\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2491072\" style=\"width: 1900px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2491072\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-2491072 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/klarna_affirm_2y-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1890\" height=\"1112\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/klarna_affirm_2y-1.jpg 1890w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/klarna_affirm_2y-1.jpg?resize=150,88 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/klarna_affirm_2y-1.jpg?resize=300,177 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/klarna_affirm_2y-1.jpg?resize=768,452 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/klarna_affirm_2y-1.jpg?resize=680,400 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/klarna_affirm_2y-1.jpg?resize=1536,904 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/klarna_affirm_2y-1.jpg?resize=1200,706 1200w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/klarna_affirm_2y-1.jpg?resize=50,29 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1890px) 100vw, 1890px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2491072\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits: <\/strong><em>Notice<\/em><\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>Reports Tage Kene-Okafor: \u201cAfrican cross-border payments platform <b>Chipper Cash<\/b> conducted a second round of layoffs\u2026just 10 weeks after it <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/12\/06\/african-fintech-unicorn-chipper-cash-lays-off-about-12-5-of-staff\/\">cut approximately 12.5% of its workforce<\/a> (affecting its engineering team the most).

Galman added: \u201cMarket concerns around BNPL are not evident to date, with loan loss rates remaining low. However, BNPL remains an area to focus on, given low-income consumers are especially pressured with inflation pressures.

id=\"speakable-summary\">Last week marked the first time the U.S. Supreme Court reviewed Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996. In <a href=\"https:\/\/www.c-span.org\/video\/?525323-1\/supreme-court-hears-big-tech-legal-liability-case\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">oral arguments<\/a> in the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.scotusblog.com\/case-files\/cases\/gonzalez-v-google-llc\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Gonzalez v. Google case<\/a>, important questions were raised about platform responsibility and the risk of viral content.<\/p>\n<p>As the court grapples with these questions, it is an opportunity to reflect on why 230 was created in the first place, how it fosters innovation and what we all stand to lose if the protections embedded within 230 are narrowed.<\/p>\n<p>Nicknamed the \u201c26 words that created the internet\u201d by Jeff Kosseff, Section 230 established a liability shield for platforms that host third-party content. In the nascent days of the internet, 230 created favorable legal conditions for startups and entrepreneurs to flourish, cementing the United States as a world leader in software.<\/p>\n<p>While today\u2019s tech landscape is dramatically different from the fledgling internet of the &#8217;90s, the reasoning behind Section 230 still holds true today. The architecture of law creates conditions for innovation and can also chill it.<\/p>\n<p>Seemingly lost in arguments taking aim at the outsized influence of large social media platforms is an appreciation of how Section 230 supports the broader online ecosystem, especially software developers. Developers are at the heart of our online world and at the forefront of creating solutions for global challenges, working to make the software that underpins our digital infrastructure more secure, reliable and safe.<\/p>\n<p>\t<div class=\"article-block block--pullout block--right\">\n\t\t<blockquote>\n\t\t\tPolicymakers should recognize the critical role of developers and work to support them, not stifle innovation.\t\t\t\t\t<\/blockquote>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<\/p>\n<p>Developers rely on 230 to collaborate on platforms like GitHub and to build and operate new platforms rethinking social media. Narrowing 230 protections could have far-reaching implications, introducing legal uncertainty into the important work of software developers, startups and platforms that provide them the tools to realize their vision. As policymakers consider how to address new frontiers of intermediary liability, it\u2019s essential to center developers in decisions that will shape the future of the internet.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Software developers contribute significantly to the United States\u2019 economic competitiveness and innovation and are important stakeholders in platform policy. GitHub counts 17 million American developers on our platform \u2014 more than any other country. Their open source activity alone contributes more than $100 billion to the U.S. economy annually.<\/p>\n<p>These developers maintain the invisible but essential software infrastructure that powers our daily lives. Nearly all software \u2014 97% \u2014 contains open source components, which are often developed and maintained on GitHub.<\/p>\n<p>As the chief legal officer at GitHub, a global community of over 100 million software developers collaborating on code, I know firsthand the importance of keeping 230 intact. While GitHub is a far cry from a general-purpose social media platform, GitHub depends on 230 protections to both host third-party content and engage in good-faith <a href=\"https:\/\/github.blog\/2023-02-15-2022-transparency-report\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">content moderation<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s especially important when a platform has over 330 million software repositories. GitHub has been able to grow while maintaining platform health thanks to intermediary liability protections. GitHub has a robust, <a href=\"https:\/\/github.blog\/2021-11-17-githubs-developer-first-approach-to-content-moderation\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">developer-first approach to content moderation<\/a> to keep our platform safe, healthy and inclusive while tailoring our approach to the unique environment of code collaboration, where the takedown of a single project can have significant downstream effects for thousands or more software projects.<\/p>\n<p>When it comes to the specifics of the Gonzalez v. Google case, which asks the court to consider whether Section 230\u2019s liability protections ought to include third-party content recommended by algorithms, a ruling in favor of the petitioners could have unintended consequences for developers. Recommendation algorithms are used throughout software development in myriad ways that are distinct from general-purpose social media platforms.<\/p>\n<p>GitHub\u2019s contributions to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.supremecourt.gov\/DocketPDF\/21\/21-1333\/252578\/20230119093338723_Microsoft%20Section%20230%20Brief.pdf#page=33\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Microsoft\u2019s amicus brief<\/a> in the case outline our concerns: Recommendations powered by algorithms on GitHub are used to connect users with similar interests, let them find relevant software projects and are even used to recommend ways to improve code and fix software vulnerabilities. One such example is GitHub\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/codeql.github.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">CodeQL<\/a>, a semantic code analysis engine that allows developers to discover vulnerabilities and errors in open source code.<\/p>\n<p>Developers are using GitHub to maintain open source projects that employ algorithmic recommendations to block hate speech and remove malicious code. A decision by the court to narrow 230 to exclude protection for recommendation algorithms could quickly ensnare a variety of societally valuable services, including tools that maintain the quality and security of the software supply chain.<\/p>\n<p>A ruling in Gonzalez v. Google that seeks to pull back protections benefiting social media platforms has the potential to impact a much broader community. In the lead-up to the court hearing the case, a host of amicus briefs emphasized its far-reaching implications: from nonprofits (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.supremecourt.gov\/DocketPDF\/21\/21-1333\/252719\/20230119161248736_21-1333bsacWikimediaFoundation.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Wikimedia Foundation<\/a>) to community content moderation (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.supremecourt.gov\/DocketPDF\/21\/21-1333\/252674\/20230119145120402_Gonzalez%20-%20Reddit%20bottomside%20amicus%20brief.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Reddit and Reddit moderators<\/a>) and small businesses and startups (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.supremecourt.gov\/DocketPDF\/21\/21-1333\/252665\/20230119142111251_43070%20pdf%20Gellis.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Engine<\/a>).<\/p>\n<p>While calls to narrow 230 focus mainly on putting Big Tech in check, doing so would unintentionally curb competition and innovation while creating additional barriers to entry for the next generation of developers and emerging providers.<\/p>\n<p>These concerns are not hyperbole: In \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/scholarlycommons.law.emory.edu\/elj\/vol63\/iss3\/3\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">How Law Made Silicon Valley<\/a>,\u201d Anupam Chander examines how the U.S. legal system created favorable conditions for internet entrepreneurship in contrast to Europe, where \u201cconcerns about copyright violations and strict privacy protections hobbled internet startups,\u201d and Asia, where \u201cAsian web enterprises faced not only copyright and privacy constraints, but also strict intermediary liability rules.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Narrowing 230 wouldn\u2019t just harm the United States\u2019 global competitiveness; it would impede tech progress <em>within<\/em> the U.S. While GitHub has gone a long way from our startup beginnings, we\u2019re committed to leveling the playing field so anyone, anywhere, can be a developer.<\/p>\n<p>As we await the court\u2019s decision in Gonzalez v. Google, it\u2019s important to note that whatever the result of the case, there will surely be more efforts to narrow 230, whether they are taking aim at algorithmic recommendations, AI or other innovations. While these new technologies raise important questions about the future of intermediary liability, policymakers must strive to chart a path forward that creates a legal environment that supports developers, startups, small businesses and nonprofits that power so many socially beneficial parts of the internet.<\/p>\n<p>Policymakers concerned about reducing harmful content can look to how developers are leading the way in content moderation. Developers use GitHub to develop valuable software projects, including open source content moderation algorithms that reflect policymakers\u2019 calls for algorithmic transparency on platforms, such as the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/bill\/117th-congress\/senate-bill\/3572?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22algorithmic+transparency%22%2C%22algorithmic%22%2C%22transparency%22%5D%7D&amp;s=1&amp;r=5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Algorithmic Accountability Act of 2022<\/a> and the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/bill\/117th-congress\/senate-bill\/1896?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22algorithmic+transparency%22%2C%22algorithmic%22%2C%22transparency%22%5D%7D&amp;s=1&amp;r=3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Algorithmic Justice and Online Platform Transparency Act<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Platforms including <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/twitter\/communitynotes\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Twitter<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/bumble-tech\/private-detector\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Bumble<\/a>\u00a0and <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/wikimedia\/ores\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Wikimedia<\/a> have used GitHub to share the source code for algorithms that flag misinformation, filter lewd imagery and block spam, respectively.

The paid subscription includes other features as well, including improved impersonation protection and direct access to customer support, plus more visibility through upranked posts. It&#8217;s initially <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/02\/24\/meta-verified-is-rolling-out-to-users-in-australia-and-new-zeland\/\">rolling out to Australia and New Zealand<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Twitter&#8217;s initial attempt at paid verification proved problematic, as users bought the badge then changed their name and profile picture to troll other high-profile accounts (including Musk) and businesses. Twitter had to pause the service and readjust.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Seemingly learning from Twitter&#8217;s mistakes, Meta&#8217;s paid badge has a few more rules in place.<\/p>\n<p>For starters, users must verify their identity with a government-issued ID card, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/02\/22\/meta-verified-wont-let-you-change-name-username-or-profile-photo-for-now\/\">and then won\u2019t be able to change<\/a> their profile name, username, date of birth or photo after paying for verification. If they later want to make a change, they&#8217;ll need to unsubscribe and then get reverified. This dramatically cuts down on bad actors, though could be a bit of a pain for creators who like to refresh their photos from time to time. However, it may not always be this way &#8212; Meta said it&#8217;s working on a feature that will eventually allow users to change these settings through a new verification process that won&#8217;t require them to cancel and resubscribe&#8230; it&#8217;s just not ready yet.<\/p>\n<p>Also of note: Meta Verified won&#8217;t verify users across Facebook and Instagram &#8212; users will have to buy separate plans for the two apps, and Facebook&#8217;s subscription, for now, is only sold on the web. That means customers will be shelling out $27 per month at the current prices for access to this badge and other perks across Meta&#8217;s apps. (The subscription is $11.99 per month on the web and $14.99 per month on iOS or Android.)<\/p>\n<p>The trend toward paid verification is a potentially fraught move for social networks like Meta and Twitter, as they&#8217;re now responsible for services that users believe should be free &#8212; things like safety, security and customer service. Being able to identify an account as authentic is seen as a feature the networks should provide to ensure that their users can trust who they&#8217;re interacting with. And being able to get help with problems like impersonation or other customer support issues is also considered something that should be a part of the social network&#8217;s core service. By stratifying these features into pay-to-play tiers, the networks are setting up a system where people with money have a better class of service than those with less to spend. But security and trust shouldn&#8217;t be sold as if they&#8217;re upgraded seats on an airplane, they should be baked into the core offering.<\/p>\n<h3>Instagram co-founders launch their new app&#8230; and it&#8217;s for news<\/h3>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2477785\" style=\"width: 1210px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2477785\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-2477785 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Product_Shot.jpeg\" alt=\"Artifact displayed on smartphone laid on colored tiles\/blocks\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Product_Shot.jpeg 1200w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Product_Shot.jpeg?resize=150,100 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Product_Shot.jpeg?resize=300,200 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Product_Shot.jpeg?resize=768,512 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Product_Shot.jpeg?resize=680,453 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Product_Shot.jpeg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2477785\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Artifact<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\"><a href=\"https:\/\/artifact.news\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Artifact<\/a>, the\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/01\/31\/instagrams-co-founders-introduce-a-new-social-app-for-news-reading\/\">personalized news reader built by Instagram\u2019s co-founders<\/a>, is now open to the public, no sign-up required.

But it will also group your reading more narrowly by specific topics. In other words, instead of just \u201ctech\u201d or \u201cAI,\u201d you might find you\u2019ve read a lot about the topic \u201cChatGPT,\u201d specifically.<\/p>\n<p>The launch of a brand-new app from Instagram\u2019s founders, and particularly one focused on news, was a surprise \u2014 especially given the difficulties of\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2014\/3\/6\/5475778\/the-smarter-news-apps-are-the-dumber-they-get\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">launching a news reader here in the U.S.<\/a>, where it would have to compete with offerings from the tech giants, like\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/06\/21\/google-news-launches-a-new-desktop-design-with-topic-customization\/\">Google News<\/a>, Apple News and, of course \u2014 from the founders\u2019 earlier employer \u2014 Meta\u2019s own News Feed. But Systrom believes that the underlying machine learning technology being used will help Artifact differentiate itself from others &#8212; it&#8217;s leveraging the transformer advances that are also powering new AI tools like ChatGPT.<\/p>\n<p>While users are likely curious about the app because of its founders&#8217; pedigree, it remains to be seen if there&#8217;s room for another news reader to carve out a niche under the tech giants&#8217; shadow. Before the waitlist was lifted, the app had around 47,000 installs, according to data.ai. As of late this past week, it had climbed to No. 4 in the U.S. App Store&#8217;s News category, but hadn&#8217;t broken into the Top Free Charts. [Update: the most recent data now shows 66K installs and the app is ranking No. 5 in the News category in the U.S., No. 5 in the UK, and higher in some EMEA markets including Malta, Spain, Israel, and Hungary.)<\/p>\n<h3>Spotify launches an AI DJ<\/h3>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2489005\" style=\"width: 324px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2489005\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"vertical size-large wp-image-2489005\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/IMG_4997.png?w=314\" alt=\"\" width=\"314\" height=\"680\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/IMG_4997.png 1290w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/IMG_4997.png?resize=69,150 69w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/IMG_4997.png?resize=138,300 138w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/IMG_4997.png?resize=768,1665 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/IMG_4997.png?resize=314,680 314w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/IMG_4997.png?resize=709,1536 709w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/IMG_4997.png?resize=945,2048 945w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/IMG_4997.png?resize=554,1200 554w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/IMG_4997.png?resize=23,50 23w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 314px) 100vw, 314px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2489005\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Spotify screenshot<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>Ah, what a time to be alive! Music streaming service Spotify this week launched an AI DJ to personalize the music listening experience for its users. Similar to a radio DJ, Spotify\u2019s DJ feature will deliver a curated selection of music alongside, in its case, AI-powered spoken commentary about the tracks and artists you like, using what Spotify says is a \u201cstunningly realistic voice.\u201d (The voice is based on Spotify\u2019s Head of Cultural Partnerships Xavier \u201cX\u201d Jernigan, who had hosted Spotify\u2019s morning show podcast, \u201cThe Get Up.\u201d)<\/p>\n<p>To access the DJ, you\u2019ll head to the Music Feed on the Home page of Spotify\u2019s iOS or Android app, then tap Play on the DJ card to begin. The DJ will then begin to play a lineup of music and short commentary. As listeners engage with the DJ feature, they\u2019ll be presented with a personalized stream of songs that will include both newer tracks and old favorites, and a variety of genres. But it&#8217;s not a long-running playlist. After you move through one style of music or selection (like your summer throwbacks), you&#8217;re then presented with another (like your favorite hip-hop tracks). This experience feels more like Spotify tied its personalized playlists together, then interspersed them with commentary.<\/p>\n<p>The interesting thing here is that Spotify said it&#8217;s leveraging Generative AI through the use of OpenAI technology to create the commentary, which is meant to scale its in-house music experts&#8217; insights about music, artists and genres. Meanwhile, its AI voice comes from its <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/06\/13\/spotify-is-acquiring-sonantic-the-ai-voice-platform-used-to-simulate-val-kilmers-voice-in-top-gun-maverick\/\">2022 Sonantic acquisition.<\/a> Spotify has led the market for years with its personalization tech for crafting playlists, but now its rivals have their own versions of this type of experience. By adding an AI DJ, Spotify hopes to attract and retain users who want a more lean-back experience while introducing a new feature that can&#8217;t be quickly copied by the competition.<\/p>\n<h1>Platforms<\/h1>\n<h3>Apple<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Apple is offering <a href=\"https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/news\/?id=tfb0r2ql\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">new sessions with App Store experts<\/a> February 28 through April 13<\/strong> that will focus on measuring with App Analytics and growing a subscription business using App Store features.<\/li>\n<li><strong>The <a href=\"https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/apple-store\/id375380948\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Apple Store app added the ability to share a saved list<\/a> with friends and family<\/strong> and more ways to access the saved lists from within the app. It&#8217;s also now offering more info about your local stores and their surroundings.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Google<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Google has begun to <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/02\/23\/google-third-party-billing-india\/\">support third-party payments in the Play Store in India<\/a><\/strong> to comply with local regulations.

Then I jump into three themes that stand out from the week, with extra reading for those that want to dig in more. I end with notes to know from around the tech blogosphere, TC events and, if you look closely enough, personal anecdotes that often have to do with coffee and food. Ok, now onto the aforementioned essay!\u00a0<\/em><\/p>\n<p>It all started with a sound. More specifically, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/Archives\/edgar\/data\/1966096\/000196609623000001\/xslFormDX01\/primary_doc.xml\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">an SEC filing from Sound Ventures<\/a>, actor and entrepreneur Ashton Kutcher\u2019s venture firm, confirmed plans to raise an artificial intelligence-focused venture firm. Bloomberg estimates that the new investment vehicle <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2023-02-10\/ashton-kutcher-s-sound-ventures-considers-200-million-ai-fund\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">could total around $200 million dollars upon close.<\/a><\/p>\n<p>While Kutcher\u2019s firm has been around for a long time and has lived through enough hype cycles to not be easily swayed one way or another, the filing made me curious. Are we going to see more celebrity-led venture firms jump onto the AI bandwagon? Especially since crypto, the hype train\u2019s ol\u2019 favorite sector, has sputtered and struggled in recent months?<\/p>\n<p>If you ask me, I\u2019d bet that we won\u2019t see the same rush of celebrities looking to promote AI products on their Instagram stories the way they promoted [insert coin offering here].

Luckily, there\u2019s a startup angle to tell us more. TC\u2019s Christine Hall wrote about <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/02\/17\/higher-egg-prices-yield-demand-for-alternatives\/\">how higher egg prices have burst open a bigger demand for alternatives.<\/a> If you\u2019re like me and just know about Just Egg, this story is illuminating for so many reasons.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Here\u2019s why it&#8217;s important, Hall tells me: \u201c<\/strong>There wasn&#8217;t a definitive yes or no about pushing the gas pedal on [alternative egg startups] getting more product out there. I was hoping someone would say, yes, startups should go for it, or no, this is just a passing thing and they should wait.

At the time of announcement, the deal was largely seen as Adobe taking out one of its biggest rivals in the design world. Immediately, folks including TC\u2019s Ingrid Lunden <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/09\/15\/adobe-is-buying-figma-for-20b-taking-out-one-of-its-biggest-rivals-in-digital-design\/\">rang some alarm bells<\/a> around Adobe\u2019s future dominance, as both a platform and tooling leader in the space.<\/p>\n<p>Also, Ehab Bandar, founder at design consultancy Bigtable.co, told<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/09\/26\/designers-underwhelmed-by-adobe-figma-deal\/\"> TechCrunch back in September<\/a> that \u201cdesigners, and especially cross-functional teams, hate to switch software. Any new tool would need to excel at so many things that Figma is currently doing that it\u2019s hard to imagine any new competitors coming out of the woodwork.\u201d Others saw a potential liquidity event as an opportunity to usher in a new generation of creative, and perhaps entrepreneurial, designers.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/01\/10\/a-timeline-for-startup-ma-processes-key-steps-and-factors-to-consider\/\">A timeline for startup M&amp;A processes: Key steps and factors to consider<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/02\/22\/fintech-klarna-ceo-on-u-s-growth-momentum\/\">Klarna wins over the US<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/01\/11\/google-germany-data-processing-fco-statement-of-objections\/\">Google users not given sufficient choice over its data processing, says German antitrust watchdog<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2429223\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2429223\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2429223\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/TechCrunch-Disrupt-Haje-Kamps-780.jpg\" alt=\"Dylan Field, CEO at Figma on the TechCrunch Disrupt stage in San Francisco on October 20, 2022.

entirely immune from 2022\u2019s market uncertainty \u2014 except maybe AI \u2014 but some proved more resilient than others. Biotech was one of the most fortunate.<\/p>\n<p>The sector recorded 1,054 U.S.-based deals in 2022, worth a collective $30.7 billion, according to Pitchbook <a href=\"https:\/\/pitchbook.com\/news\/reports\/q4-2022-pitchbook-nvca-venture-monitor\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">data<\/a>. Those figures fell short of the 1,415 biotech deals struck in 2021 worth a total of $39 billion.

href=\"http:\/\/pod.link\/chainreaction\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Chain Reaction<\/a>, a podcast diving deep into the stories, backgrounds and latest news with the biggest names in crypto.<\/p>\n<p>For this week\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/chain-reaction.simplecast.com\/episodes\/bitcoin-rewards-and-nfts-are-helping-its-ecosystem-w-alex-adelman\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">episode<\/a>, I interviewed Alex Adelman, the co-founder and CEO of Lolli. Founded in 2018, Lolli is a bitcoin rewards app that lets people earn bitcoin or cash back when they shop online or in-person at over 10,000 stores like McDonald\u2019s, Starbucks, Dunkin&#8217;, CVS, Costco and so on. Adelman previously was on the team that built commerce gateway Cosmic, which was acquired by PopSugar in 2015 before ultimately folding into Ebates (now Rakuten) in 2017.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve been selling bitcoin to merchants since 2013,\u201d Adelman said. \u201cSo it wasn\u2019t a new sell \u2014 for better or for worse, I was the bitcoin guy for a lot of Fortune 500 merchants.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Lolli has grown significantly over the past few years, from partnering with less than 500 stores in its first few months to more than 10,000 stores to date. Adelman dived into the rewards system in the crypto ecosystem and how it has evolved over the years \u2014 and what the future holds for Lolli.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been talking about the future of loyalty and its involvement in crypto for a very long time,\u201d Adelman said. \u201cNow it\u2019s coming to fruition.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The episode also dived deep into the topic of <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/02\/14\/bitcoin-nfts-are-growing-quickly-as-community-sees-long-term-potential\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Bitcoin NFTs<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/02\/16\/ordinals-creator-views-his-bitcoin-centric-creation-as-digital-artifacts-not-just-nfts\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Ordinals<\/a>, the latest craze for the community. We discussed whether Bitcoin NFTs are good for the ecosystem, how the technology can grow in the long term and possibilities for these digital inscriptions to potentially fit into Lolli\u2019s business model.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m a big believer the best NFTs are memes that are going to last forever and art that\u2019s going to last forever,\u201d Adelman said. \u201cWhen things have utility it has a finite value to it, opposed to an infinite belief it can be the next Mona Lisa. That\u2019s the differentiator: We\u2019ve been intentional about what has value.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>In the future, Adelman also thinks more artists and projects will launch on Bitcoin. \u201cI think you\u2019ll start to see Lightning marketplaces emerge where you can buy and sell Bitcoin NFTs probably within the next few months,\u201d Adelman added. \u201cArtists want to build in ecosystems where there\u2019s liquidity, where there\u2019s people to buy, and there\u2019s no better ecosystem than Bitcoin.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Chain Reaction comes out every other Thursday at 12:00 p.m. PT, so be sure to subscribe to us on<a href=\"https:\/\/podcasts.apple.com\/us\/podcast\/chain-reaction\/id1616008890\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> Apple Podcasts,<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/show\/6dC9jw0YyPqnul5P3CECoN\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Spotify<\/a> or your favorite pod platform to keep up with the action.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Welcome back to Chain Reaction, a podcast diving deep into the stories, backgrounds and latest news with the biggest names in crypto.
